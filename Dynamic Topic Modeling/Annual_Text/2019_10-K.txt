PART I
Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements
This Annual Report on Form 10-K and other reports, statements, and information that Walmart Inc. (which individually or together with its subsidiaries, as the context otherwise requires, is referred to as
"we," "Walmart" or the "Company") has filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") or may file with or furnish to the SEC in the future, and prior or future public
announcements and presentations that we or our management have made or may make, include or may include, or incorporate or may incorporate by reference, statements that may be deemed to be
"forward-looking statements" within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Act"), that are intended to enjoy the protection of the safe harbor for forwardlooking statements provided by the Act.
Nature of Forward-Looking Statements
Such forward-looking statements are not statements of historical facts, but instead express our estimates or expectations for our consolidated, or one of our segment's, economic performance or results of

including as adjusted for certain items, net sales, comparable store and club sales, our Walmart U.S. operating segment's eCommerce sales, liabilities, expenses of certain categories, expense
leverage, returns, capital and operating investments or expenditures of particular types, new store openings and investments in particular formats;

• our commitments, intentions, plans or goals related to the sustainability of our environment and supply chains, the promotion of economic opportunity or other societal initiatives.
Our forward-looking statements may also include statements of our strategies, plans and objectives for our operations, including areas of future focus in our operations, and the assumptions underlying

ITEM 1.

BUSINESS

General
Walmart Inc. ("Walmart," the "Company" or "we") helps people around the world save money and live better – anytime and anywhere – by providing the opportunity to shop in retail stores and through
eCommerce. Through innovation, we strive to continuously improve a customer-centric experience that seamlessly integrates our eCommerce and retail stores in an omni-channel offering that saves
time for our customers. Each week, we serve nearly 275 million customers who visit our more than 11,300 stores and numerous eCommerce websites under 58 banners in 27 countries.
Our strategy is to make every day easier for busy families, operate with discipline, sharpen our culture and become digital, and make trust a competitive advantage. Making life easier for busy families
includes our commitment to price leadership, which has been and will remain a cornerstone of our business, as well as increasing convenience to save our customers time. By leading on price, we earn
the trust of our customers every day by providing a broad assortment of quality merchandise and services at everyday low prices ("EDLP"). EDLP is our pricing philosophy under which we price items
at a low price every day so our customers trust that our prices will not change under frequent promotional activity. Everyday low cost ("EDLC") is our commitment to control expenses so our cost
savings can be passed along to our customers.
Our operations comprise three reportable segments: Walmart U.S., Walmart International and Sam's Club. Our fiscal year ends on January 31 for our United States ("U.S.") and Canadian operations. We
consolidate all other operations generally using a one-month lag and on a calendar year basis. Our discussion is as of and for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2019 ("fiscal 2019 "), January 31, 2018
("fiscal 2018 ") and January 31, 2017 ("fiscal 2017 "). During fiscal 2019 , we generated total revenues of $514.4 billion , which was primarily comprised of net sales of $510.3 billion .
We maintain our principal offices at 702 S.W. 8th Street, Bentonville, Arkansas 72716, USA. Our common stock trades on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "WMT."
The Development of Our Company
Although Walmart was incorporated in Delaware in October 1969, the businesses conducted by our founders began in 1945 when Sam M. Walton opened a franchise Ben Franklin variety store in
Newport, Arkansas. In 1946, his brother, James L. Walton, opened a similar store in Versailles, Missouri. Until 1962, our founders' business was devoted entirely to the operation of variety stores. In that
year, the first Wal-Mart Discount City, which was a discount store, opened in Rogers, Arkansas. In 1983, we opened our first Sam's Club, and in 1988, we opened our first supercenter. In 1998, we
opened our first Walmart Neighborhood Market. In 1991, we began our first international initiative when we entered into a joint venture in Mexico. Since then, our international presence has expanded
and, as of January 31, 2019 , our Walmart International segment conducted business in 26 countries.
In 2000, we began our first eCommerce initiative by creating walmart.com. That same year, we also created samsclub.com. Since then, our eCommerce presence has continued to grow. In 2007,
leveraging our physical stores, walmart.com launched its Site to Store service, enabling customers to make a purchase online and pick up merchandise in stores. In 2016, we acquired jet.com in the U.S.
and formed a strategic alliance with JD.com in China. Since the jet.com purchase, we have continued to expand our U.S. eCommerce capabilities through acquisitions including Shoes.com, Moosejaw,
Bonobos and other digital consumer brands. In 2017, walmart.com launched free two-day shipping on more than 2 million items and we created Store N o 8, a technology incubator with a focus to drive
commerce forward. In fiscal 2019, we acquired a majority stake of Flipkart Private Limited ("Flipkart"), an Indian-based eCommerce marketplace , with an ecosystem that includes eCommerce
platforms of Flipkart, Myntra and Jabong. In the U.S., we added more grocery pickup and delivery locations and as of January 31, 2019, we offered grocery pickup at more than 2,100 locations and
grocery delivery at nearly 800 locations. Our eCommerce efforts and innovation have led to omni-channel offerings in many of our markets. We are building an ecosystem with our omni-channel
capabilities, stores, services, eCommerce sites, supply chain and more than 2.2 million associates to better serve our customers.
Information About Our Segments
We are engaged in global operations of retail, wholesale and other units, as well as eCommerce, located throughout the U.S., Africa, Argentina, Canada, Central America, Chile, China, India, Japan,
Mexico and the United Kingdom, as well as Brazil prior to the sale of the majority stake of Walmart Brazil discussed in Note 13 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Our operations are conducted
in three reportable segments: Walmart U.S., Walmart International and Sam's Club. We define our segments as those operations whose results the chief operating decision maker ("CODM") regularly
reviews to analyze performance and allocate resources. Each of our segments contributes to the Company's operating results differently. Each, however, has generally maintained a consistent
contribution rate to the Company's net sales and operating income in recent years other than minor changes to the contribution rate for the Walmart International segment due to fluctuations in currency
exchange rates. We sell similar individual products and services in each of our segments. It is impractical to segregate and identify revenues for each of these individual products and services.
7

We measure the results of our segments using, among other measures, each segment's net sales and operating income, which includes certain corporate overhead allocations. From time to time, we revise
the measurement of each segment's operating income, including any corporate overhead allocations, as determined by the information regularly reviewed by our CODM. When the measurement of a
segment changes, previous period amounts and balances are reclassified to be comparable to the current period's presentation. In fiscal 2019, we revised certain of our corporate overhead allocations to
the operating segments and, accordingly, revised prior period amounts for comparability.
Walmart U.S. Segment
Walmart U.S. is our largest segment and operates in the U.S., including in all 50 states, Washington D.C. and Puerto Rico. Walmart U.S. is a mass merchandiser of consumer products, operating under
the "Walmart" and "Walmart Neighborhood Market" brands, as well as walmart.com, jet.com and other eCommerce brands. Walmart U.S. had net sales of $331.7 billion for fiscal 2019 , representing
65% of our fiscal 2019 consolidated net sales, and had net sales of $318.5 billion and $307.8 billion for fiscal 2018 and 2017 , respectively. Of our three segments, Walmart U.S. has historically had the
highest gross profit as a percentage of net sales ("gross profit rate"). In addition, Walmart U.S. has historically contributed the greatest amount to the Company's net sales and operating income.
Omni-channel. Walmart U.S. provides an omni-channel experience to customers, integrating retail stores and eCommerce , through services such as "Walmart Pickup," "Pickup Today", "Grocery
Pickup", "Grocery Delivery," and "Endless Aisle." As of January 31, 2019, we had over 2,100 Grocery Pickup locations and nearly 800 Grocery Delivery locations. Our eCommerce websites include
walmart.com, jet.com and others. The following table provides the approximate size of our retail stores as of January 31, 2019 :

Merchandise. Walmart U.S. does business in three strategic merchandise units, listed below:
•
•

Grocery consists of a full line of grocery items, including meat, produce, natural & organics, deli & bakery, dairy, frozen foods, alcoholic and nonalcoholic beverages, floral and dry grocery, as
well as consumables such as health and beauty aids, baby products, household chemicals, paper goods and pet supplies;
Health and wellness includes pharmacy, optical services, clinical services, and over-the-counter drugs and other medical products;
8

•

General merchandise includes:
◦ Entertainment (e.g., electronics, cameras and supplies, photo processing services, wireless, movies, music, video games and books);
◦ Hardlines (e.g., stationery, automotive, hardware and paint, sporting goods, outdoor living and horticulture);
◦ Apparel (e.g., apparel for women, girls, men, boys and infants, as well as shoes, jewelry and accessories); and
◦ Home/Seasonal (e.g., home furnishings, housewares and small appliances, bedding, home decor, toys, fabrics and crafts and seasonal merchandise).

Walmart U.S. also offers fuel and financial services and related products, including money orders, prepaid cards, wire transfers, money transfers, check cashing and bill payment. These services total less
than 1% of annual net sales.
Brand name merchandise represents a significant portion of the merchandise sold in Walmart U.S. We also market lines of merchandise under our private-label brands, including brands such as:
"Athletic Works," "Bonobos," "Equate," "Everstart," "George," "Great Value," "Holiday Time," "Mainstays," "Marketside," "ModCloth," "No Boundaries," "Onn," "Ozark Trail," "Parent's Choice,"
"Time and Tru" and "Wonder Nation." The Company also markets lines of merchandise under licensed brands, some of which include: "Better Homes & Gardens," "Farberware," "Russell" and
"SwissTech."
Periodically, revisions are made to the categorization of the components comprising our strategic merchandise units. When revisions are made, the previous periods' presentation is adjusted to maintain
comparability.
Operations. Many supercenters, discount stores and neighborhood markets are open 24 hours each day. A variety of payment methods are accepted.
Seasonal Aspects of Operations. Walmart U.S.'s business is seasonal to a certain extent due to calendar events and national and religious holidays, as well as different weather patterns. Historically, its
highest sales volume and segment operating income have occurred in the fiscal quarter ending January 31.
Competition. Walmart U.S. competes with omni-channel retailers operating discount, department, retail and wholesale grocers, drug, dollar, variety and specialty stores, supermarkets, hypermarkets and
supercenter-type stores, as well as eCommerce retailers. Our ability to develop, open and operate units at the right locations and to deliver a customer-centric omni-channel experience largely determines
our competitive position within the retail industry. We employ many programs designed to meet competitive pressures within our industry. These programs include the following:
• EDLP: our pricing philosophy under which we price items at a low price every day so our customers trust that our prices will not change under frequent promotional activity;
• EDLC: everyday low cost is our commitment to control expenses so our cost savings can be passed along to our customers; and
• Omni-channel offerings such as Walmart Pickup, where a customer places an order online and picks it up for free from a store; Pickup Today, where a customer places an order online and picks
it up for free from a store; Grocery Delivery, where a customer places a grocery order online and has it delivered; or Grocery Pickup, where a customer places a grocery order online and picks it
up at one of our participating stores or remote locations.
Distribution. For fiscal 2019 , approximately 77% of Walmart U.S.'s purchases of store merchandise were shipped through our 156 distribution facilities, which are located strategically throughout the
U.S. The remaining store merchandise we purchased was shipped directly from suppliers. General merchandise and dry grocery merchandise is transported primarily through the segment's private truck
fleet; however, we contract with common carriers to transport the majority of our perishable grocery merchandise. We ship merchandise purchased by customers on our eCommerce platforms by a
number of methods from multiple locations including from our 33 dedicated eCommerce fulfillment centers.
Walmart International Segment
Walmart International is our second largest segment and operates in 26 countries outside of the U.S. Walmart International operates through our wholly-owned subsidiaries in Argentina, Canada, Chile,
China, India, Japan and the United Kingdom, as well as Brazil prior to the sale of the majority stake of Walmart Brazil discussed in Note 13 to our Consolidated Financial Statements; and our majorityowned subsidiaries in Africa (which includes Botswana, Ghana, Kenya, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Nigeria, South Africa, Swaziland, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia), Central America
(which includes Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua), India and Mexico.
Walmart International includes numerous formats divided into three major categories: retail, wholesale and other. These categories consist of many formats, including: supercenters, supermarkets,
hypermarkets, warehouse clubs (including Sam's Clubs) and cash & carry, as well as eCommerce through walmart.com.mx, asda.com, walmart.ca, flipkart.com and other sites.

Walmart International had net sales of $120.8 billion for fiscal 2019 , representing 24% of our fiscal 2019 consolidated net sales, and had net sales of $118.1 billion and $116.1 billion for fiscal 2018 and
2017 , respectively. The segment's net sales have been negatively impacted by currency exchange rate fluctuations for all years presented. The gross profit rate is lower than that of Walmart U.S.
primarily because of its merchandise mix.
To deliver strong efficient growth, we have to be decisive when it comes to our capital and our time. As such, we have taken certain strategic actions to reposition Walmart International, including:
•

Acquisition of a majority stake of Flipkart in August 2018 for $16 billion, or $13.8 billion net of cash acquired. We began consolidating Flipkart's results in the third quarter of fiscal 2019,
using a one-month lag . The ongoing operations negatively impacted fiscal 2019 net income and this negative impact will continue in fiscal 2020.

•

Proposed combination of J Sainsbury plc and Asda Group Limited ("Asda"), our wholly-owned United Kingdom retail subsidiary. Under the terms, we would receive approximately 42 percent
of the share capital of the combined company and approximately £3.0 billion in cash, subject to customary closing adjustments, while retaining obligations under the Asda defined benefit
pension plan . Due to a complex regulatory review process, the outcome of which is uncertain and may take some time to complete, the held for sale classification criteria for the disposal group
has not been met as of January 31, 2019. Further, there can be no assurance as to whether regulatory approval will be obtained or the proposed combination will be consummated. In the future,
if the held for sale classification criteria is met for the disposal group, we expect to recognize a loss, the amount of which may fluctuate based on the changes in the value of share capital
received and foreign exchange rates.

•

Divestiture of 80 percent of Walmart Brazil to Advent International (“Advent”) in August 2018. Advent agreed to contribute additional capital to the business over a three-year period and we
agreed to indemnify Advent for certain pre-closing tax and legal contingencies and other matters. We recorded a pre-tax net loss of $4.8 billion in fiscal 2019 for the sale, of which $2.0 billion
related to cumulative foreign currency translation loss which was reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss.

•

Consistent with our focus on core retail capabilities, the divestiture of the Walmart Chile banking operations in December 2018 and the proposed divestiture of the Walmart Canada banking
operations , classified as held for sale as of January 31, 2019 .

Omni-channel. Walmart International provides an omni-channel experience to customers, integrating retail stores and eCommerce , such as through services like "Click & Collect" in the United
Kingdom, our grocery pick-up and delivery business in several other markets, and our marketplaces, such as Flipkart in India.
Generally, retail units range in size from 1,500 square feet to 186,000 square feet. Our wholesale stores generally range in size from 25,000 square feet to 155,000 square feet. Other includes stand-alone
gas stations operating in the United Kingdom, which range in size up to 2,200 square feet.

Merchandise. The merchandising strategy for Walmart International is similar to that of our operations in the U.S. in terms of the breadth and scope of merchandise offered for sale. While brand name
merchandise accounts for a majority of our sales, we have both leveraged U.S. private brands and developed market specific private brands to serve our customers with high quality, low priced items.
Along with the private brands we market globally, such as "Equate," "George," "Great Value," "Holiday Time," "Mainstays," "Marketside," and "Parent's Choice," our international markets have
developed market specific brands including "Aurrera," "Cambridge," "Lider," "Myntra," "Jabong," "PhonePe," and "Extra Special." In addition, we have developed relationships with regional and local
suppliers in each market to ensure reliable sources of quality merchandise that is equal to national brands at low prices.
Operations. The hours of operation for operating units in Walmart International vary by country and by individual markets within countries, depending upon local and national ordinances governing
hours of operation. Operating units in each country accept a variety of payment methods.
Seasonal Aspects of Operations. Walmart International's business is seasonal to a certain extent. Historically, the segment's highest sales volume and operating income have occurred in the fourth
quarter of our fiscal year. The seasonality of the business varies by country due to different national and religious holidays, festivals and customs, as well as different weather patterns.
Competition. Walmart International competes with omni-channel retailers who operate department, drug, discount, variety and specialty stores, supermarkets, hypermarkets and supercenter-type stores,
wholesale clubs, home-improvement stores, specialty electronics stores, cash & carry operations and convenience stores, and eCommerce retailers, as well as catalog businesses. Our ability to develop,
open and operate units at the right locations and to deliver a customer-centric omni-channel experience largely determines our competitive position within the retail industry. We believe price leadership
is a critical part of our business model and we continue to focus on moving our markets towards an EDLP approach. Additionally, our ability to operate food departments effectively has a significant
impact on our competitive position in the markets where we operate.
11

Distribution. We utilize a total of 226 distribution facilities located in Argentina, Canada, Central America, Chile, China, Japan, Mexico, South Africa, India and the United Kingdom. Through these
facilities, we process and distribute both imported and domestic products to the operating units of the Walmart International segment. During fiscal 2019 , approximately 83% of Walmart International's
purchases passed through these distribution facilities. Suppliers ship the balance of Walmart International's purchases directly to our stores in the various markets in which we operate. We ship
merchandise purchased by customers on our eCommerce platforms by a number of methods from multiple locations including from our 90 dedicated eCommerce fulfillment centers, as well as more than
1,900 eCommerce sort centers in India.
Sam's Club Segment
Sam's Club operates in 44 states in the U.S. and in Puerto Rico. Sam's Club is a membership-only warehouse club that also operates samsclub.com. Sam's Club had net sales of $57.8 billion for fiscal
2019 , representing 11% of our consolidated fiscal 2019 net sales, and had net sales of $59.2 billion and $57.4 billion for fiscal 2018 and 2017 , respectively. As a membership-only warehouse club,
membership income is a significant component of the segment's operating income. Sam's Club operates with a lower gross profit rate and lower operating expenses as a percentage of net sales than our
other segments.
Membership. The following two options are available to members:
Plus Membership
Annual Membership Fee
Number of Add-on Memberships ($40 each)
Eligible for Cash Rewards

Club Membership

$100

$45

Up to 16

Up to 8

All memberships include a spouse/household card at no additional cost. Plus Members are eligible for Cash Rewards, which is a benefit that provides $10 for every $500 in qualifying Sam's Club
purchases up to a $500 cash reward annually. The amount earned can be used for purchases, membership fees or redeemed for cash. Plus Members are also eligible for Free Shipping on the majority of
merchandise, with no minimum order size, and receive discounts on prescriptions, glasses and contacts.
Omni-channel. While Sam's Club is a membership-only warehouse club, it provides an omni-channel experience to customers, integrating retail stores and eCommerce . The warehouse facility sizes
generally range between 34,000 and 168,000 square feet, with an average size of approximately 134,000 square feet. The following table provides the retail unit count and retail square feet for the fiscal
years shown :

Members have access to a broad assortment of merchandise, including products not found in our clubs, and services online at samsclub.com and through our mobile commerce applications, providing
the option of delivery direct-to-home or to the club through services such as "Club Pickup." Sam's Club omni-channel capabilities also include "Scan and Go," a mobile checkout and payment solution,
which allows members to bypass the checkout line.
Merchandise. Sam's Club offers merchandise in the following five merchandise categories:
• Grocery and consumables includes dairy, meat, bakery, deli, produce, dry, chilled or frozen packaged foods, alcoholic and nonalcoholic beverages, floral, snack foods, candy, other grocery
items, health and beauty aids, paper goods, laundry and home care, baby care, pet supplies and other consumable items;
• Fuel and other categories consists of gasoline stations, tobacco, tools and power equipment, and tire and battery centers;
• Home and apparel includes home improvement, outdoor living, grills, gardening, furniture, apparel, jewelry, housewares, toys, seasonal items, mattresses and small appliances;
• Technology, office and entertainment includes electronics, wireless, software, video games, movies, books, music, office supplies, office furniture, photo processing and third-party gift cards;
and
• Health and wellness includes pharmacy, optical and hearing services and over-the-counter drugs.
The Member's Mark brand continues to expand assortment and deliver member value. In fiscal 2019 , Member's Mark sales exceeded $12 billion, driven by growth across multiple categories in the
private brand portfolio.
Operations. Operating hours for Sam's Clubs are generally Monday through Friday from 10:00 a.m. to 8:30 p.m., Saturday from 9:00 a.m. to 8:30 p.m. and Sunday from 10:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m.
Additionally, all club locations offer Plus Members the ability to shop before the regular operating hours Monday through Saturday, starting at 7:00 a.m. A variety of payment methods are accepted.
12

Seasonal Aspects of Operations. Sam's Club's business is seasonal to a certain extent due to calendar events and national and religious holidays, as well as different weather patterns. Historically, its
highest sales volume and segment operating income have occurred in the fiscal quarter ending January 31.
Competition. Sam's Club competes with other membership-only warehouse clubs, the largest of which is Costco, as well as with discount retailers, retail and wholesale grocers, general merchandise
wholesalers and distributors, gasoline stations as well as omni-channel and eCommerce retailers and catalog businesses. At Sam's Club, we provide value at members-only prices, a quality merchandise
assortment, and bulk sizing to serve both our Plus and Club members. Our eCommerce website and mobile commerce applications have increasingly become important factors in our ability to compete.
Distribution. During fiscal 2019 , approximately 70% of Sam's Club's non-fuel club purchases were shipped from Sam's Club's 23 dedicated distribution facilities, located strategically throughout the
U.S., or from some of the Walmart U.S. segment's distribution facilities, which service the Sam's Club segment for certain items. Suppliers shipped the balance of the Sam's Club segment's club
purchases directly to Sam's Club locations. Sam's Club ships merchandise purchased on samsclub.com and through its mobile commerce applications by a number of methods from its six dedicated
eCommerce fulfillment centers and other distribution centers, including two dedicated import facilities.
The principal focus of Sam's Club's distribution operations is on cross-docking merchandise while minimizing stored inventory. Cross-docking is a distribution process under which shipments are
directly transferred from inbound to outbound trailers. Shipments typically spend less than 24 hours in a cross-dock facility, and sometimes less than an hour.
Sam's Club uses a combination of our private truck fleet, as well as common carriers, to transport non-perishable merchandise from distribution facilities to clubs. The segment contracts with common
carriers to transport perishable grocery merchandise from distribution facilities to clubs.
Intellectual Property
We regard our trademarks, service marks, copyrights, patents, domain names, trade dress, trade secrets, proprietary technologies, and similar intellectual property as important to our success, and with
respect to our associates, customers and others, we rely on trademark, copyright, and patent law, trade-secret protection, and confidentiality and/or license agreements to protect our proprietary rights.
We have registered, or applied for the registration of, a number of U.S. and international domain names, trademarks, service marks and copyrights. Additionally, we have filed U.S. and international
patent applications covering certain of our proprietary technology. We have licensed in the past, and expect that we may license in the future, certain of our proprietary rights to third parties.
Suppliers and Supply Chain
As a retailer and warehouse club operator, we utilize a global supply chain that includes over 100,000 suppliers located around the world, including in the United States, from whom we purchase the
merchandise that we sell in our stores, clubs and online. In many instances, we purchase merchandise from producers located near the stores and clubs in which such merchandise will be sold,
particularly products in the "fresh" category. Our purchases may represent a significant percentage of a number of our suppliers' annual sales, and the volume of product we acquire from many suppliers
allows us to obtain favorable pricing from such suppliers. Our suppliers are subject to standards of conduct, including requirements that they comply with local labor laws, local worker safety laws and
other applicable laws. Our ability to acquire from our suppliers the assortment and volume of products we wish to offer to our customer, to receive those products within the required time through our
supply chain and to distribute those products to our stores and clubs determines, in part, our in-stock levels in our stores and clubs and the attractiveness of our merchandise assortment we offer to our
customers and members.
Employees
As of the end of fiscal 2019 , Walmart Inc. and our subsidiaries employed more than 2.2 million employees ("associates") worldwide, with 1.5 million associates in the U.S. and 0.7 million associates
internationally. Similar to other retailers, the Company has a large number of part-time, hourly or non-exempt associates. We believe our relationships with our associates are good. A large number of
associates turn over each year, although Walmart U.S. turnover has improved in both fiscal 2019 and 2018 as a result of our focus on increasing wages and providing improved tools, technology and
training to associates.
Certain information relating to retirement-related benefits we provide to our associates is included in Note 12 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition to retirement-related benefits, in the
U.S. we offer a broad range of Company-paid benefits to our associates. These include a store discount card or Sam's Club membership, bonuses based on Company performance, matching a portion of
associate purchases of our stock through our Associate Stock Purchase Plan and life insurance. In addition to the health-care benefits for eligible full-time and part-time associates in the U.S., we offer
maternity leave and a paid parental leave program to all full-time associates. We also offer a $5,000 benefit to assist eligible associates with adoption. Additionally, we offer eligible associates tuition
assistance towards earning a college degree. Similarly, in the
13

operations outside the U.S., we provide a variety of associate benefits that vary based on customary local practices and statutory requirements.

of petroleum products, including crude oil, natural gas, gasoline, and diesel fuel, higher costs for electricity and other energy, weakness in the housing market, inflation, deflation, increased costs of
essential services, such as medical care and utilities, higher levels of unemployment, decreases in consumer disposable income, unavailability of consumer credit, higher consumer debt levels, changes in
consumer spending and shopping patterns, fluctuations in currency exchange rates, higher tax rates, imposition of new taxes or other changes in tax laws, changes in healthcare laws, other regulatory
changes, the imposition of tariffs or other measures that create barriers to or increase the costs associated with international trade, overall economic slowdown or recession and other economic factors in
the U.S. or in any of the other markets in which we operate could adversely affect consumer demand for the products we sell in the U.S. or such other markets, change the mix of products we sell to one
with a lower average gross margin, cause a slowdown in discretionary purchases of goods, adversely affect our net sales and result in slower inventory turnover and greater markdowns of inventory, or
otherwise materially adversely affect our operations and operating results and could result in impairment charges to intangible assets, goodwill or other long-lived assets.
In addition, the economic factors listed above, any other economic factors or circumstances resulting in higher transportation, labor, insurance or healthcare costs or commodity prices, and other
economic factors in the U.S. and other countries in which we operate can increase our cost of sales and operating, selling, general and administrative expenses and otherwise materially adversely affect
our operations and operating results.
The economic factors that affect our operations may also adversely affect the operations of our suppliers, which can result in an increase in the cost to us of the goods we sell to our customers or, in more
extreme cases, in certain suppliers not producing goods in the volume typically available to us for sale.
We face strong competition from other retailers and wholesale club operators which could materially adversely affect our financial performance.
Each of our segments competes for customers, employees, digital prominence, products and services and in other important aspects of its business with many other local, regional, national and global
eCommerce and omni-channel retailers, wholesale club operators and retail intermediaries.
We compete in a variety of ways, including the prices at which we sell our merchandise, merchandise selection and availability, services offered to customers, location, store hours, in-store amenities,
the shopping convenience and overall shopping experience we offer, the attractiveness and ease of use of our digital platforms, cost and speed of and options for delivery to customers of merchandise
purchased through our digital platforms or through our omni-channel integration of our physical and digital operations.

A failure to respond effectively to competitive pressures and changes in the retail markets or delays or failure in execution of our strategy could materially adversely affect our financial performance. See
" Item 1. Business " above for additional discussion of the competitive situation of each of our reportable segments.
Certain segments of the retail industry are undergoing consolidation, which could result in increased competition and significantly alter the dynamics of the retail marketplace. Other segments are
substantially reducing operations which could also result in competition rushing to fill the void created by such corporate actions. Such consolidation, or other business combinations or alliances, or
reduction in operation may result in competitors with greatly improved financial resources, improved access to merchandise, greater market penetration than they previously enjoyed and other
improvements in their competitive positions. Such business combinations or alliances could result in the provision of a wider variety of products and services at competitive prices by such consolidated
or aligned companies, which could adversely affect our financial performance.
We may not timely identify or effectively respond to consumer trends or preferences, which could negatively affect our relationship with our customers, demand for the products and services
we sell, our market share and the growth of our business.
It is difficult to predict consistently and successfully the products and services our customers will demand and changes in their shopping patterns. The success of our business depends in part on how
accurately we predict consumer demand, availability of merchandise, the related impact on the demand for existing products and the competitive environment. Price transparency, assortment of products,
customer experience, convenience, ease and the speed and cost of shipping are of primary importance to customers and continue to increase in importance, particularly as a result of digital tools and
social media available to consumers and the choices available to consumers for purchasing products. Our failure to adequately or effectively respond to changing consumer tastes, preferences and
shopping patterns, or any other failure on our part to timely identify or effectively respond to changing consumer tastes, preferences and shopping patterns could negatively affect our relationship with
our customers, the demand for the products we sell, our market share and the growth of our business.
Failure to successfully execute our omni-channel strategy and the cost of our increasing eCommerce investments may materially adversely affect our market position, net sales and financial
performance.
The retail business is rapidly evolving and consumers are increasingly embracing shopping digitally. As a result, the portion of total consumer expenditures with retailers and wholesale clubs occurring
through digital platforms is increasing and the pace of this increase could accelerate.
Our strategy, which includes acquisitions, joint ventures, investments in eCommerce, technology, store remodels and other customer initiatives may not adequately or effectively allow us to grow our
eCommerce business, increase comparable store sales, maintain or grow our overall market position or otherwise offset the impact on the growth of our business of a moderated pace of new store and
club openings. The success of this strategy will depend in large measure on our ability to build and deliver a seamless omni-channel shopping experience and is further subject to the risks we face as
outlined in this Item 1A . As a result, our market position, net sales and financial performance could be adversely affected, which could also result in impairment charges to intangible assets or other
long-lived assets. In addition, a greater concentration of eCommerce sales could result in a reduction in the amount of traffic in our stores and clubs, which would, in turn, reduce the opportunities for
cross-store or cross-club sales of merchandise that such traffic creates and could reduce our sales within our stores and clubs and materially adversely affect our financial performance.
Furthermore, the cost of certain eCommerce and technology investments, including any operating losses incurred will adversely impact our financial performance in the short-term and may adversely
impact our financial performance over the longer term.
The performance of strategic alliances and other business relationships to support the expansion of our business could materially adversely affect our financial performance.
We may enter into strategic alliances and other business relationships in the countries in which we have existing operations or in other markets to expand our retail operations. These arrangements may
not generate the level of sales we anticipate when entering into the arrangement or may otherwise adversely impact our business and competitive position relative to the results we could have achieved in
the absence of such alliance. In addition, any investment we make in connection with a strategic alliance or business relationship could materially adversely affect our financial performance.
Operational Risks
Natural disasters, changes in climate, and geo-political events could materially adversely affect our financial performance.
The occurrence of one or more natural disasters, such as hurricanes, tropical storms, floods, fires, earthquakes, tsunamis, cyclones, typhoons, weather conditions such as major or extended winter storms,
droughts and tornadoes, whether as a result of climate change or otherwise, severe changes in climate and geo-political events, such as war, civil unrest or terrorist attacks in a
16

country in which we operate or in which our suppliers are located could adversely affect our operations and financial performance.
Such events could result in physical damage to, or the complete loss of, one or more of our properties, the closure of one or more stores, clubs and distribution facilities, the lack of an adequate work
force in a market, the inability of customers and associates to reach or have transportation to our stores and clubs affected by such events, the evacuation of the populace from areas in which our stores,
clubs and distribution facilities are located, the unavailability of our digital platforms to our customers, changes in the purchasing patterns of consumers and in consumers' disposable income, the
temporary or long-term disruption in the supply of products from some suppliers, the disruption in the transport of goods from overseas, the disruption or delay in the delivery of goods to our distribution
facilities or stores within a country in which we are operating, the reduction in the availability of products in our stores, the disruption of utility services to our stores and our facilities, and disruption in
our communications with our stores.
We bear the risk of losses incurred as a result of physical damage to, or destruction of, any stores, clubs and distribution facilities, loss or spoilage of inventory and business interruption caused by such
events. These events and their impacts could otherwise disrupt and adversely affect our operations in the areas in which they occur and could materially adversely affect our financial performance.
Risks associated with our suppliers could materially adversely affect our financial performance.
The products we sell are sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international suppliers. Global sourcing of many of the products we sell is an important factor in our financial performance. We
expect our suppliers to comply with applicable laws, including labor, safety, anti-corruption and environmental laws, and to otherwise meet our required supplier standards of conduct. Our ability to find
qualified suppliers who uphold our standards, and to access products in a timely and efficient manner, is a significant challenge, especially with respect to suppliers located and goods sourced outside the
U.S.
Political and economic instability in the countries in which our foreign suppliers and their manufacturers are located, the financial instability of suppliers, suppliers' failure to meet certain of our supplier
standards (including our responsible sourcing standards), labor problems experienced by our suppliers and their manufacturers, the availability of raw materials to suppliers, merchandise safety and
quality issues, disruption in the transportation of merchandise from the suppliers and manufacturers to our stores, clubs, and other facilities, including as a result of labor slowdowns at any port at which
a material amount of merchandise we purchase enters into the markets in which we operate, currency exchange rates, transport availability and cost, transport security, inflation and other factors relating
to the suppliers and the countries in which they are located are beyond our control.
In addition, the U.S. foreign trade policies, tariffs and other impositions on imported goods, trade sanctions imposed on certain countries, the limitation on the importation of certain types of goods or of
goods containing certain materials from other countries and other factors relating to foreign trade are beyond our control. These and other factors affecting our suppliers and our access to products could
adversely affect our financial performance.
If the products we sell are not safe or otherwise fail to meet our customers' expectations, we could lose customers, incur liability for any injuries suffered by customers using or consuming a
product we sell or otherwise experience a material impact to our brand, reputation and financial performance. We may also face reputational and other risks related to third-party sales on
our digital platforms.
Our customers count on us to provide them with safe products. Concerns regarding the safety of food and non-food products that we source from our suppliers or that we prepare and then sell could
cause customers to avoid purchasing certain products from us, or to seek alternative sources of supply for all of their food and non-food needs, even if the basis for the concern is outside of our control.
Any lost confidence on the part of our customers would be difficult and costly to reestablish and may also expose us to product liability or food safety claims. As such, any issue regarding the safety of
any food or non-food items we sell, regardless of the cause, could adversely affect our brand, reputation and financial performance. In addition, third-parties sell goods on some of our digital platforms,
which we refer to as marketplace transactions. The applicability to us of laws related to such sales is currently unsettled and we may face reputational, financial and other risks, including liability, for
third-party sales of goods that are counterfeit or otherwise fraudulent.
We rely extensively on information systems to process transactions, summarize results and manage our business. Disruptions in our systems could harm our ability to conduct our operations.
Given the number of individual transactions we have each year, it is crucial that we maintain uninterrupted operation of our business-critical information systems. Our information systems are subject to
damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, worms, other malicious computer programs, denial-of-service attacks, security breaches
(through cyber-attacks from cyber-attackers and sophisticated organizations), catastrophic events such as fires, tornadoes, earthquakes and hurricanes, and usage errors by our associates or contractors.
Our information systems are essential to our business operations, including the processing of transactions, management of our associates, facilities, logistics, inventories, physical stores and clubs and
our online operations. Our information systems are not fully
17

redundant and if our systems are damaged, breached or cease to function properly, we may have to make a significant investment to repair or replace them, and we may suffer interruptions in our
business operations in the interim. Any interruption to our information systems may have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations. In addition, we are constantly updating our
information technology processes and systems. The risk of system disruption is increased when significant system changes are undertaken. If we fail to timely integrate and update our information
systems and processes, we may fail to realize the cost savings anticipated to be derived from these initiatives.
If the technology-based systems that give our customers the ability to shop with us online do not function effectively, our operating results, as well as our ability to grow our eCommerce
business globally, could be materially adversely affected.
Increasingly, customers are using computers, tablets, and smart phones to shop with us and with our competitors and to do comparison shopping. We use social media and electronic mail to interact with
our customers and as a means to enhance their shopping experience. As a part of our omni-channel sales strategy, in addition to home delivery, we offer "Walmart Pickup," "Pickup Today," "Club
Pickup" and "Online Grocery" programs under which many products available for purchase online can be picked up by the customer at a local Walmart store or Sam's Club, which provides additional
customer traffic at such stores and clubs. Omni-channel retailing is a rapidly evolving part of the retail industry and of our operations in the U.S. (whether through organic growth or eCommerce
acquisitions) and in a number of markets in which our Walmart International segment operates.
We must anticipate and meet our customers' changing expectations while adjusting for technology investments and developments in our competitors' operations through focusing on the building and
delivery of a seamless shopping experience across all channels by each operating segment. Any failure on our part to provide attractive, user-friendly secure digital platforms that offer a wide assortment
of merchandise at competitive prices and with low cost and rapid delivery options and that continually meet the changing expectations of online shoppers and developments in online and digital platform
merchandising and related technology could place us at a competitive disadvantage, result in the loss of eCommerce and other sales, harm our reputation with customers, have a material adverse impact
on the growth of our eCommerce business globally and have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations.
Our digital platforms, which are increasingly important to our business and continue to grow in complexity and scope, and the computer and operating systems on which they run, including those
applications and systems in our acquired eCommerce businesses, are regularly subject to cyber-attacks. Those attacks involve attempts to gain access to our eCommerce websites (including marketplace
platforms) or mobile commerce applications to obtain and make unauthorized use of customers' or members' payment information and related risks discussed below. Such attacks, if successful, may also
create denials of service or otherwise disable, degrade or sabotage one or more of our digital platforms and otherwise significantly disrupt our customers' and members' shopping experience. If we are
unable to maintain the security of our digital platforms and keep them operating within acceptable parameters, we could suffer loss of sales, reductions in traffic, reputational damage and deterioration of
our competitive position and incur liability for any damage to customers whose personal information is unlawfully obtained and used, any of which events could have a material adverse impact on our
business and results of operations and impede the execution of our strategy for the growth of our business.
Any failure to maintain the security of the information relating to our company, customers, members, associates and vendors, whether as a result of cybersecurity attacks on our information
systems or otherwise, could damage our reputation, result in litigation or other legal actions against us, cause us to incur substantial additional costs, and materially adversely affect our
business and operating results.
As do most retailers, we receive and store in our digital information systems certain personal information about our customers and members, and we receive and store personal information concerning
our associates and vendors. Some of that information is stored digitally in connection with our digital platforms. We also utilize third-party service providers for a variety of reasons, including, without
limitation, for encryption and authentication technology, content delivery to customers and members, back-office support, and other functions. Such providers may have access to information we hold
about our customers, members, associates or vendors. In addition, our eCommerce operations depend upon the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks, including
information permitting cashless payments.
Cyber threats are rapidly evolving and those threats and the means for obtaining access to information in digital and other storage media are becoming increasingly sophisticated. Cyber threats and
cyber-attackers can be sponsored by countries or sophisticated criminal organizations or be the work of single "hackers" or small groups of "hackers." Each year, cyber-attackers make numerous
attempts to access the information stored in our information systems. As cyber threats evolve, change and become more difficult to detect and successfully defend against, one or more cyber-attacks
might defeat our or a third-party service provider's security measures in the future and obtain the personal information of customers, members, associates and vendors.
18

Associate error or malfeasance, faulty password management or other irregularities may also result in a defeat of our or our third-party service providers' security measures and a breach of our or their
information systems. Moreover, hardware, software or applications we use may have inherent defects of design, manufacture or operations or could be inadvertently or intentionally implemented or used
in a manner that could compromise information security. We or our third-party service providers may not discover any security breach and loss of information for a significant period of time after the
security breach occurs.
Any breach of our security measures or any breach, error or malfeasance of those of our third-party service providers and loss of our confidential information, or any failure by us to comply with
applicable privacy and information security laws and regulations, could cause us to incur significant costs to protect any customers, members, associates and vendors whose personal data was
compromised and to restore their confidence in us and to make changes to our information systems and administrative processes to address security issues and compliance with applicable laws and
regulations.
In addition, such events could be widely publicized and could materially adversely affect our reputation with our customers, members, associates, vendors and shareholders, could harm our competitive
position particularly with respect to our eCommerce operations, and could result in a material reduction in our net sales in our eCommerce operations, as well as in our stores thereby materially
adversely affecting our operations, net sales, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and liquidity. Such events could also result in the release to the public of confidential information about
our operations and financial condition and performance and could result in litigation or other legal actions against us or the imposition of penalties, fines, fees or liabilities, which may not be covered by
our insurance policies. Moreover, a security breach could require us to devote significant management resources to address the problems created by the security breach and to expend significant
additional resources to upgrade further the security measures we employ to guard personal information against cyber-attacks and other attempts to access such information and could result in a disruption
of our operations, particularly our digital operations.
We accept payments using a variety of methods, including cash, checks, credit and debit cards, our private label credit cards and gift cards, and we may offer new payment options over time, which may
have information security risk implications. As a retailer accepting debit and credit cards for payment, we are subject to various industry data protection standards and protocols, such as payment
network security operating guidelines and the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard. We cannot be certain that the security measures we maintain to protect all of our information technology
systems are able to prevent, contain or detect any cyber-attacks, cyber terrorism, or security breaches from known cyber-attacks or malware that may be developed in the future. To the extent that any
cyber-attack or incursion in our or one of our third-party service provider's information systems results in the loss, damage or misappropriation of information, we may be materially adversely affected
by claims from customers, financial institutions, regulatory authorities, payment card networks and others. In certain circumstances, payment card association rules and obligations to which we are
subject under our contracts with payment card processors make us liable to payment card issuers if information in connection with payment cards and payment card transactions that we hold is
compromised, which liabilities could be substantial. In addition, the cost of complying with stricter and more complex data privacy, data collection and information security laws and standards could be
significant to us.
Changes in the results of our retail pharmacy business could adversely affect our overall results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.
Walmart has retail pharmacy operations in our Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club segments. A large majority of our retail pharmacy net sales are generated by filling prescriptions for which we receive
payment through established contractual relationships with third-party payers and payment administrators, such as private insurers, governmental agencies and pharmacy benefit managers ("PBMs").
Our retail pharmacy operations are subject to numerous risks, including: reductions in the third-party reimbursement rates for drugs; changes in our payer mix (i.e., shifts in the relative distribution of our
pharmacy customers across drug insurance plans and programs toward plans and programs with less favorable reimbursement terms); changes in third party payer drug formularies (i.e., the schedule of
prescription drugs approved for reimbursement or which otherwise receive preferential coverage treatment); growth in, and our participation in or exclusion from, exclusive and preferred pharmacy
network arrangements operated by PBMs and/or any insurance plan or program; increases in the prices we pay for brand name and generic prescription drugs we sell; increases in the administrative
burdens associated with seeking third-party reimbursement; changes in the frequency with which new brand name pharmaceuticals become available to consumers; introduction of lower cost generic
drugs as substitutes for existing brand name drugs for which there was no prior generic drug competition; changes in drug mix (i.e., the relative distribution of drugs customers purchase at our
pharmacies between brands and generics); changes in the health insurance market generally; changes in the scope of or the elimination of Medicare Part D or Medicaid drug programs; increased
competition from other retail pharmacy operations; further consolidation among third party payers, PBMs or purchasers of drugs; overall economic conditions and the ability of our pharmacy customers
to pay for drugs prescribed for them to the extent the costs are not reimbursed by a third party; failure to meet any performance or incentive thresholds to which our level of third party reimbursement
may be subject; and changes in the regulatory environment for the retail pharmacy industry and the pharmaceutical industry, including as a result of restrictions on the further implementation of or the
repeal of
19

the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act or the enactment and implementation of a law replacing such act, and other changes in laws, rules and regulations that affect our retail pharmacy business.
If the supply of certain pharmaceuticals provided by one or more of our vendors were to be disrupted for any reason, our pharmacy operations could be severely affected until at least such time as we
could obtain a new supplier for such pharmaceuticals. Any such disruption could cause reputational damage and result in a significant number of our pharmacy customers transferring their prescriptions
to other pharmacies.
One or a combination of such factors may adversely affect the volumes of brand name and generic pharmaceuticals we sell, our cost of sales associated with our retail pharmacy operations, and the net
sales and gross margin of those operations or result in the loss of cross-store or cross-club selling opportunities and, in turn, adversely affect our overall net sales, other results of operations, cash flows
and liquidity.
Our failure to attract and retain qualified associates, increases in wage and benefit costs, changes in laws and other labor issues could materially adversely affect our financial performance.
Our ability to continue to conduct and expand our operations depends on our ability to attract and retain a large and growing number of qualified associates globally. Our ability to meet our labor needs,
including our ability to find qualified personnel to fill positions that become vacant at our existing stores, clubs and distribution centers, while controlling our associate wage and related labor costs, is
generally subject to numerous external factors, including the availability of a sufficient number of qualified persons in the work force of the markets in which we operate, unemployment levels within
those markets, prevailing wage rates, changing demographics, health and other insurance costs and adoption of new or revised employment and labor laws and regulations. If we are unable to locate, to
attract or to retain qualified personnel, the quality of service we provide to our customers may decrease and our financial performance may be adversely affected.
In addition, if our costs of labor or related costs increase for other reasons or if new or revised labor laws, rules or regulations or healthcare laws are adopted or implemented that further increase our
labor costs, our financial performance could be materially adversely affected.
Financial Risks
Fluctuations in foreign exchange rates may materially adversely affect our financial performance and our reported results of operations.
Our operations in countries other than the U.S. are conducted primarily in the local currencies of those countries. Our consolidated financial statements are denominated in U.S. dollars, and to prepare
those financial statements we must translate the amounts of the assets, liabilities, net sales, other revenues and expenses of our operations outside of the U.S. from local currencies into U.S. dollars using
exchange rates for the current period. In recent years, fluctuations in currency exchange rates that were unfavorable have had adverse effects on our reported results of operations.
As a result of such translations, fluctuations in currency exchange rates from period-to-period that are unfavorable to us may also result in our consolidated financial statements reflecting significant
adverse period-over-period changes in our financial performance or reflecting a period-over-period improvement in our financial performance that is not as robust as it would be without such
fluctuations in the currency exchange rates. Such unfavorable currency exchange rate fluctuations will adversely affect the reported performance of our Walmart International operating segment and
have a corresponding adverse effect on our reported consolidated results of operations.
We may pay for products we purchase for sale in our stores and clubs around the world with a currency other than the local currency of the country in which the goods will be sold. When we must
acquire the currency to pay for such products and the exchange rates for the payment currency fluctuate in a manner unfavorable to us, our cost of sales may increase and we may be unable or unwilling
to change the prices at which we sell those goods to address that increase in our costs, with a corresponding adverse effect on our gross profit. Consequently, fluctuations in currency exchange rates may
adversely affect our results of operations.
Failure to meet market expectations for our financial performance could adversely affect the market price and volatility of our stock.
We believe that the price of our stock generally reflects high market expectations for our future operating results. Any failure to meet or delay in meeting these expectations, including our comparable
store and club sales growth rates, eCommerce growth rates, gross margin, or earnings and earnings per share could cause the market price of our stock to decline, as could changes in our dividend or
stock repurchase programs or policies. Additionally, failure of Walmart's performance to compare favorably to that of other retailers may have a negative effect on the price of our stock.
20

Legal, Tax, Regulatory, Compliance, Reputational and Other Risks
Our international operations subject us to legislative, judicial, accounting, legal, regulatory, tax, political and economic risks and conditions specific to the countries or regions in which we
operate, which could materially adversely affect our business or financial performance.
In addition to our U.S. operations, we operate our retail business in Africa, Argentina, Canada, Central America, Chile, China, India, Japan, Mexico and the United Kingdom.
During fiscal 2019, our Walmart International operations generated approximately 24% of our consolidated net sales. Walmart International's operations in various countries also sources goods and
services from other countries. Our future operating results in these countries could be negatively affected by a variety of factors, most of which are beyond our control. These factors include political
conditions, including political instability, local and global economic conditions, legal and regulatory constraints (such as regulation of product and service offerings including regulatory restrictions on
eCommerce offerings in international markets, such as India), restrictive governmental actions (such as trade protection measures), local product safety and environmental laws, tax regulations, local
labor laws, anti-money laundering laws and regulations, trade policies, currency regulations, laws and regulations regarding consumer and data protection, and other matters in any of the countries or
regions in which we operate, now or in the future.
Our business and results of operations in the UK may be negatively affected by increases in food costs, changes in trade policies, changes in labor, immigration, tax or other laws and fluctuations in
currency exchange rates resulting from the UK's pending exit from the European Union. We expect continued uncertainty around the extent of the impact of this exit on our business until the UK and the
European Union put in alternative trade and other arrangements.
The economies of some of the countries in which we have operations have in the past suffered from high rates of inflation and currency devaluations, which, if they occurred again, could adversely affect
our financial performance. Other factors which may impact our international operations include foreign trade, monetary and fiscal policies of the U.S. and of other countries, laws, regulations and other
activities of foreign governments, agencies and similar organizations, and risks associated with having numerous facilities located in countries which have historically been less stable than the U.S.
Additional risks inherent in our international operations generally include, among others, the costs and difficulties of managing international operations, adverse tax consequences and greater difficulty
in enforcing intellectual property rights in countries other than the U.S. The various risks inherent in doing business in the U.S. generally also exist when doing business outside of the U.S., and may be
exaggerated by the difficulty of doing business in numerous sovereign jurisdictions due to differences in culture, laws and regulations.
In foreign countries in which we have operations, a risk exists that our associates, contractors or agents could, in contravention of our policies, engage in business practices prohibited by U.S. laws and
regulations applicable to us, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act ("FCPA"), or the laws and regulations of other countries, such as the UK Bribery Act. We maintain a global policy prohibiting
such business practices and have in place a global anti-corruption compliance program designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations. Nevertheless, we remain subject to the risk that
one or more of our associates, contractors or agents, including those based in or from countries where practices that violate such U.S. laws and regulations or the laws and regulations of other countries
may be customary, will engage in business practices that are prohibited by our policies, circumvent our compliance programs and, by doing so, violate such laws and regulations. Any such violations,
even if prohibited by our internal policies, could adversely affect our business or financial performance and our reputation.
Changes in tax and trade laws and regulations could materially adversely affect our financial performance.
In fiscal 2019, our Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club operating segments generated approximately 76% of our consolidated net sales. The federal government has created the potential for significant changes
in trade policies, including tariffs and government regulations affecting trade between the U.S. and other countries where we source many of the products we sell in our stores and clubs. Potential
changes which have been discussed include the renegotiation or termination of trade agreements and the imposition of higher tariffs on imports into the U.S. A significant portion of the general
merchandise we sell in our U.S. stores and clubs is manufactured in other countries. Any such actions could increase the cost to us of such merchandise (whether imported directly or indirectly) and
cause increases in the prices at which we sell such merchandise to our customers, which could materially adversely affect the financial performance of our U.S. operations and our business.
We are subject to income taxes and other taxes in both the U.S. and the foreign jurisdictions in which we currently operate or have historically operated. The determination of our worldwide provision
for income taxes and current and deferred tax assets and liabilities requires judgment and estimation. Our income taxes could be materially adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in
jurisdictions that have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions that have higher statutory tax rates, by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, or by
changes in worldwide tax laws, regulations, or accounting principles.
21

For example, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the "Tax Act") significantly changed income tax laws that affect U.S. corporations and there are aspects of the Tax Act that remain unclear as additional
guidance from the U.S. tax authority is pending. As further guidance is issued by the U.S. Treasury Department, the IRS, and other standard-setting bodies, any resulting changes in our estimates will be
treated in accordance with the relevant accounting guidance.
In addition, we are subject to regular review and audit by both domestic and foreign tax authorities as well as subject to the prospective and retrospective effects of changing tax regulations and
legislation. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the ultimate tax outcome may materially differ from the tax amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements and may
materially affect our income tax provision, net income, or cash flows in the period or periods for which such determination and settlement is made.
Changes in and/or failure to comply with other laws and regulations specific to the environments in which we operate could materially adversely affect our reputation, market position, or our
business and financial performance.
We operate in complex regulated environments in the United States and in the other countries in which we operate and could be adversely affected by changes to existing legal requirements including the
related interpretations and enforcement practices, new legal requirements and/or any failure to comply with applicable regulations.
Our pharmacy operations in the United States are subject to numerous federal, state and local regulations including licensing and other requirements for pharmacies and reimbursement arrangements.
The regulations to which we are subject include, but are not limited to: federal and state registration and regulation of pharmacies; dispensing and sale of controlled substances and products containing
pseudoephedrine; applicable governmental payer regulations including Medicare and Medicaid; data privacy and security laws and regulations including the Health Insurance Portability and
Accountability Act, the Affordable Care Act, laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and health and safety matters, including those governing exposure to, and the management
and disposal of, hazardous substances; regulations regarding food and drug safety including those of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the "FDA") and the Drug Enforcement Administration (the
"DEA"), trade regulations including those of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, and consumer protection and safety regulations including those of the Consumer Product Safety Commission, as well as
state regulatory authorities, governing the availability, sale, advertisement and promotion of products we sell and the financial services we offer; anti-kickback laws; false claims laws; and federal and
state laws governing health care fraud and abuse and the practice of the professions of pharmacy, optical care and nurse practitioner services.
For example, in the United States the DEA and various other regulatory authorities regulate the distribution and dispensing of pharmaceuticals and controlled substances. We are required to hold valid
DEA and state-level licenses, meet various security and operating standards and comply with the federal and various state controlled substance acts and related regulations governing the sale, dispensing,
disposal and holding of controlled substances. The DEA, the FDA and state regulatory authorities have broad enforcement powers, including the ability to seize or recall products and impose significant
criminal, civil and administrative sanctions for violations of these laws and regulations.
We are also governed by foreign, national and state laws and regulations of general applicability, including laws and regulations related to working conditions, health and safety, equal employment
opportunity, employee benefit and other labor and employment matters, laws and regulations related to competition, and antitrust matters, and health and wellness related regulations for our pharmacy
operations outside of the United States. In addition, certain financial services we offer or make available, such as our money transfer agent services, are subject to legal and regulatory requirements,
including those intended to help detect and prevent money laundering, fraud and other illicit activity. The impact of new laws, regulations and policies and the related interpretations and changes in
enforcement practices or regulatory scrutiny generally cannot be predicted, and changes in applicable laws, regulations and policies and the related interpretations and enforcement practices may require
extensive system and operational changes, be difficult to implement, increase our operating costs, require significant capital expenditures, or adversely impact the cost or attractiveness of the products or
services we offer.
Untimely compliance or noncompliance with applicable laws and regulations could result in the imposition of civil and criminal penalties that could adversely affect the continued operation of our
businesses, including: suspension of payments from government programs; loss of required government certifications; loss of authorizations to participate in or exclusion from government programs,
including the Medicare and Medicaid programs in the United States; loss of licenses; and significant fines or monetary damages and/or penalties. In addition, failure to comply with applicable legal or
regulatory requirements in the United States or in any of the countries in which we operate could result in significant legal and financial exposure, damage to our reputation, and have a material adverse
effect on our business operations, financial condition and results of operations.
We are subject to certain legal proceedings that may materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
We are involved in a number of legal proceedings, which include consumer, employment, tort and other litigation. In particular, we are currently a defendant in a number of cases containing class-action
allegations in which the plaintiffs have brought claims under federal and state wage and hour laws, as well as a number of cases containing class-action allegations in which the plaintiffs have brought
claims under federal and state consumer laws.
22

In addition, ASDA Stores, Ltd. ("Asda"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, has been named as a defendant in numerous "equal value" claims pending in the Manchester Employment Tribunal
(the "Employment Tribunal") in the United Kingdom. The claimants, who are current and former Asda store employees, allege that the work performed by female employees in Asda's retail stores is of
equal value in terms of, among other things, the demands of their jobs to that of male employees working in Asda's warehouses and distribution facilities, and that the disparity in pay between these
different job positions is not objectively justified. The claimants are seeking differential back pay based on higher wage rates in the warehouses and distribution facilities and higher wage rates on a
prospective basis. At present, we cannot predict the number of such claims that may be filed, and cannot reasonably estimate any loss or range of loss that may arise from these matters .
In December 2017, the United States Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation consolidated numerous lawsuits filed against a wide array of defendants by various plaintiffs, including counties, cities,
healthcare providers, Native American tribes, individuals, and third-party payors, asserting claims generally concerning the impacts of widespread opioid abuse. The consolidated multidistrict litigation
is entitled In re National Prescription Opiate Litigation (MDL No. 2804) , and is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio. The Company is named as a defendant in some of
the cases included in this multidistrict litigation. Similar cases that name the Company have also been filed in state courts by state, local and tribal governments, health care providers and other plaintiffs.
Plaintiffs are seeking compensatory and punitive damages, as well as injunctive relief including abatement. The Company cannot predict the number of such claims that may be filed, and cannot
reasonably estimate any loss or range of loss that may arise from such claims.
We discuss these cases and other litigation to which we are party below under the caption " Item 3. Legal Proceedings " and in Note 10 in the " Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements ," which
are part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
We could be subject to liability, penalties and other sanctions and other adverse consequences arising out of our on-going FCPA matter.
As previously disclosed, we are under investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice (the "DOJ") and the SEC regarding possible violations of the FCPA. We have been cooperating with those agencies
and discussions have been ongoing with them regarding the resolution of these matters. These discussions have progressed to a point that in fiscal 2018, we reasonably estimated a probable loss and
recorded an aggregate accrual of $283 million with respect to these matters (the "Accrual").
A number of federal and local government agencies in Mexico also investigated these matters. Walmex cooperated with the Mexican governmental agencies that conducted these investigations.
Furthermore, lawsuits relating to the matters under investigation were filed by several of our shareholders against us, certain of our current and former directors and former officers and certain of
Walmex's former officers. These matters have been resolved or immaterial accruals have been made for proposed settlements.
We could be exposed to a variety of negative consequences as a result of the matters noted above. One or more enforcement actions could be instituted in respect of the matters that are the subject of
some or all of the on-going government investigations, and such actions, if brought, may result in judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions, cease and desist orders, debarment or other relief,
criminal convictions and/or penalties. Shareholder lawsuits may result in judgments against us and our current and former directors and officers named in those proceedings. We also expect that there
will be ongoing media and governmental interest regarding these matters, including additional news articles on these matters that could impact the perception among certain audiences of our role as a
corporate citizen. Moreover, we have incurred and expect to continue to incur costs in responding to requests for information or subpoenas seeking documents, testimony and other information in
connection with the government investigations, in defending the shareholder lawsuits and with respect to investigations.
While we have made an Accrual for these matters, because the discussions are continuing, there can be no assurance as to the timing or the terms of the final resolution of these matters. Although we do
not presently believe that these matters, including the Accrual (and the payment of the Accrual at some point-in-time in the future) will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position,
results of operations or cash flows, given the inherent uncertainties in such situations, we can provide no assurance that these matters will not be material to our business, financial position, results of
operations or cash flows in the future.

We own office facilities in Bentonville, Arkansas, that serve as our principal office and own and lease office facilities throughout the U.S. and internationally for operations as well as for field and
market management. The land on which our stores are located is either owned or leased by the Company. We use independent contractors to construct our buildings. All store leases provide for annual
rentals, some of which escalate during the original lease or provide for additional rent based on sales volume. Substantially all of the Company's store and club leases have renewal options, some of
which include rent escalation clauses.
For further information on our distribution centers, see the caption "Distribution" provided for each of our segments under " Item 1. Business ."

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

I. SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION: We discuss certain legal proceedings in Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, entitled "Contingencies," which is included in Part II, Item 8.
Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We refer you to that discussion for important information concerning those legal proceedings, including the basis for
such actions and, where known, the relief sought. We provide the following additional information concerning those legal proceedings, including the name of the lawsuit, the court in which the lawsuit is
pending, and the date on which the petition commencing the lawsuit was filed.
ASDA Equal Value Claims: Ms S Brierley & Others v ASDA Stores Ltd (2406372/2008 & Others - Manchester Employment Tribunal); ASDA Stores Ltd v Brierley & Ors (A2/2016/0973 - United
Kingdom Court of Appeal); ASDA Stores Ltd v Ms S Brierley & Others (UKEAT/0059/16/DM - United Kingdom Employment Appeal Tribunal); ASDA Stores Ltd v Ms S Brierley & Others
(UKEAT/0009/16/JOJ - United Kingdom Employment Appeal Tribunal).
National Prescription Opiate Litigation: In re National Prescription Opiate Litigation (MDL No. 2804) (the "MDL"). The MDL is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio
and includes 440 cases as of March 15, 2019; 27 cases are in the process of being transferred to the MDL or have remand motions pending; and there are 92 additional state cases pending as of
March 15, 2019 . The case citations for the state cases are listed on Exhibit 99.1 to this Form 10-K.
II. CERTAIN OTHER PROCEEDINGS: The Company is a defendant in a lawsuit in which the complaint closely tracks the allegations set forth in a news story that appeared in The New York Times
(the "Times") on April 21, 2012. This is a securities lawsuit, City of Pontiac General Employees Retirement System v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. , USDC, Western Dist. of AR, that was filed on May 7, 2012,
in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee, and subsequently transferred to the Western District of Arkansas, in which the plaintiff alleges various violations of the U.S.
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the
"FCPA") beginning in 2005, and asserts violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, relating to certain prior disclosures of the Company. The plaintiff
seeks to represent a class of shareholders who purchased or acquired stock of the Company between December 8, 2011, and April 20, 2012, and has sought damages and other relief based on allegations
that the defendants' conduct affected the value of such stock. On September 20, 2016, the court granted plaintiff's motion for class certification. On October 6, 2016, the defendants filed a petition to
appeal the class certification ruling to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. On November 7, 2016, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit denied the Company's petition. On
October 26, 2018, the parties filed a motion asking the court to approve a proposed settlement under which the Company would pay $160 million (the “Settlement Amount”) to resolve the claims of all
class members. On December 6, 2018, the court preliminarily approved the settlement and scheduled the final approval hearing for April 4, 2019. The settlement does not include or constitute an
admission, concession, or finding of any fault, liability, or wrongdoing by the Company or any defendant. The Settlement Amount was expensed in the Company’s fiscal 2019 financial statements.
Securities Class Action : City of Pontiac General Employees Retirement System v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., USDC, Western Dist. of AR; 5/7/12.
III. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS: Item 103 of SEC Regulation S-K requires disclosure of certain environmental matters. The following matters are disclosed in accordance with that requirement.
For the matters listed below, management does not believe any possible loss or the range of any possible loss that may be incurred in connection with each matter, individually or in the aggregate, will be
material to the Company's financial condition or results of operations.
In September 2018, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”) notified the Company that it had initiated an administrative penalty action by issuing a Draft Consent Agreement
and Final Order. The letter accompanying the Draft Consent Agreement and Final Order alleges that the Company distributed and/or sold three unregistered pesticide products from March 1, 2017
through June 23, 2017. The EPA is seeking a penalty of $960,000. The manufacturer of the product is responsible for ensuring that a FIFRA-regulated product is properly registered prior to its sale. The
Company is cooperating with the EPA.
In January 2018, the Environmental Prosecutor of the State of Chiapas (Procuraduría Ambiental del Estado de Chiapas) in Mexico imposed a fine of approximately $163,000 for the absence of an
Environmental Impact Authorization License related to the store Mi Bodega Las Rosas. The Company is challenging the fine.
26

In April 2017, the California Air Resources Board (the "ARB") notified the Company that it had taken the position that retailers are required to use unclaimed deposits collected on sales of small
containers of automotive refrigerant to fund certain consumer education programs. The ARB alleged that the Company had improperly retained approximately $4.2 million in unclaimed deposits and has
sought reimbursement. The Company has denied any wrongdoing.
In April 2013, a subsidiary of the Company, Corporacion de Compañias Agroindustriales, operating in Costa Rica, became aware that the Municipality of Curridabat is seeking a penalty of
approximately $380,000 in connection with the construction of a retaining wall for a perishables distribution center that is situated along a protected river bank. The subsidiary obtained permits from the
Municipality and the Secretaria Técnica Nacional Ambiental at the time of construction, but the Municipality now alleges that the wall is non-conforming.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Overview
This discussion, which presents our results for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2019 ("fiscal 2019 "), January 31, 2018 ("fiscal 2018 ") and January 31, 2017 ("fiscal 2017 ") should be read in
conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying notes. We intend for this discussion to provide the reader with information that will assist in understanding our financial
statements, the changes in certain key items in those financial statements from period to period and the primary factors that accounted for those changes. We also discuss certain performance metrics that
management uses to assess the Company's performance. Additionally, the discussion provides information about the financial results of each of the three segments to provide a better understanding of
how each of those segments and its results of operations affect the financial condition and results of operations of the Company as a whole.
Management measures the results of the Company's segments using each segment's operating income, including certain corporate overhead allocations, as well as other measures. From time to time, we
revise the measurement of each segment's operating income and other measures as determined by the information regularly reviewed by our chief operating decision maker. In fiscal 2019, the Company
revised certain of its corporate overhead allocations, including depreciation expense, to the operating segments and, accordingly, revised prior period amounts for comparability .
Management also measures the results of comparable store and club sales, or comparable sales, a metric that indicates the performance of our existing stores and clubs by measuring the change in sales
for such stores and clubs, including eCommerce sales, for a particular period from the corresponding period in the previous year. Walmart's definition of comparable sales includes sales from stores and
clubs open for the previous 12 months, including remodels, relocations, expansions and conversions, as well as eCommerce sales. We measure the eCommerce sales impact by including all sales
initiated online or though mobile applications, including omni-channel transactions which are fulfilled through our stores and clubs. Sales at a store that has changed in format are excluded from
comparable sales when the conversion of that store is accompanied by a relocation or expansion that results in a change in the store's retail square feet of more than five percent. Additionally, sales
related to acquisitions are excluded until such acquisitions have been owned for 12 months. Comparable sales are also referred to as "same-store" sales by others within the retail industry. The method of
calculating comparable sales varies across the retail industry. As a result, our calculation of comparable sales is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.
In discussing our operating results, the term currency exchange rates refers to the currency exchange rates we use to convert the operating results for countries where the functional currency is not the
U.S. dollar into U.S. dollars or for countries experiencing hyperinflation. We calculate the effect of changes in currency exchange rates as the difference between current period activity translated using
the current period's currency exchange rates and the comparable prior year period's currency exchange rates. Additionally, no currency exchange rate fluctuations are calculated for non-USD acquisitions
until owned for 12 months. Throughout our discussion, we refer to the results of this calculation as the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations. Volatility in currency exchange rates may impact
the results, including net sales and operating income, of the Company and the Walmart International segment in the future.
Our business is seasonal to a certain extent due to calendar events and national and religious holidays, as well as weather patterns. Generally, our highest sales volume and operating income have
occurred in the fiscal quarter ending January 31 .
We made certain strategic portfolio decisions, further discussed in Item 1. Business , which include the following:
•

Acquisition of 81 percent of the outstanding shares, or 77 percent of the diluted shares, of Flipkart Private Limited ("Flipkart") in August 2018. The ongoing operations negatively impacted
fiscal 2019 net income and this negative impact will continue in fiscal 2020.

•

Proposed combination of J Sainsbury plc and Asda Group Limited ("Asda"), where we would receive approximately 42 percent of the share capital of the combined company, however, the held
for sale criteria has not been met as of January 31, 2019. Further, there can be no assurance as to whether regulatory approval will be obtained or the proposed combination will be
consummated. In the future, if the held for sale classification criteria is met for the disposal group, we expect to recognize a loss, the amount of which may fluctuate based on the changes in the
value of share capital received and foreign exchange rates.

•

Divestiture of 80 percent of Walmart Brazil to Advent International ("Advent") in August 2018, for which we recorded a pre-tax loss of $4.8 billion in fiscal 2019.

•

Divestiture of banking operations in Walmart Chile in December 2018 and the proposed divestiture of banking operations in Walmart Canada, classified as held for sale as of January 31, 2019.

The Retail Industry
We operate in the highly competitive omni-channel retail industry in all of the markets we serve. We face strong sales competition from other discount, department, drug, dollar, variety and specialty
stores, warehouse clubs and supermarkets, as well as eCommerce businesses. Many of these competitors are national, regional or international chains or have a national or international omni-channel or
eCommerce presence. We also compete with a number of companies for attracting and retaining quality employees ("associates"). We, along with other retail companies, are influenced by a number of
factors including, but not limited to: catastrophic events, weather, competitive pressures, consumer disposable income, consumer debt levels and buying patterns, consumer credit availability, cost of
goods, currency exchange rate fluctuations, customer preferences, deflation, inflation, fuel and energy prices, general economic conditions, insurance costs, interest rates, labor costs, tax rates, the
imposition of tariffs, cybersecurity attacks and unemployment. Further information on the factors that can affect our operating results and on certain risks to our Company and an investment in its
securities can be found herein under " Item 1A. Risk Factors ," and under " Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements ."
Company Performance Metrics
We are committed to helping customers save money and live better through everyday low prices, supported by everyday low costs. At times, we adjust our business strategies to maintain and strengthen
our competitive positions in the countries in which we operate. We define our financial framework as:
•

strong, efficient growth;

•

consistent operating discipline; and

•

strategic capital allocation.

As we execute on this financial framework, we believe our returns on capital will improve over time.
Strong, Efficient Growth
Our objective of prioritizing strong, efficient growth means we will focus on the most productive growth opportunities, increasing comparable store and club sales, accelerating eCommerce sales growth
and expansion of omni-channel initiatives while slowing the rate of growth of new stores and clubs. At times, we make strategic investments which are focused on the long-term growth of the Company.
Comparable sales is a metric that indicates the performance of our existing stores and clubs by measuring the change in sales for such stores and clubs, including eCommerce sales, for a particular period
over the corresponding period in the previous year. The retail industry generally reports comparable sales using the retail calendar (also known as the 4-5-4 calendar). To be consistent with the retail
industry, we provide comparable sales using the retail calendar in our quarterly earnings releases. However, when we discuss our comparable sales below, we are referring to our calendar comparable
sales calculated using our fiscal calendar, which may result in differences when compared to comparable sales using the retail calendar.
Calendar comparable sales, as well as the impact of fuel, for fiscal 2019 and 2018 , were as follows:

Walmart U.S. comparable sales increased 3.7% and 2.1% in fiscal 2019 and 2018 , respectively, driven by ticket and traffic growth. Walmart U.S. eCommerce sales positively contributed approximately
1.3% and 0.7% to comparable sales for fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018 , respectively, as we continue to focus on a seamless omni-channel experience for our customers . Sam's Club comparable sales
increased 5.4% and 2.8% in fiscal 2019 and 2018 , respectively. Sam's Club fiscal 2019 comparable sales were driven by strong traffic, which was aided by transfers of sales from our closed clubs to our
existing clubs and fuel sales. These increases were partially offset by reduced tobacco sales due to our decision to remove tobacco from certain locations in fiscal 2019 . Sam's Club fiscal 2018 comp
sales were driven by strong traffic and fuel sales. Sam's Club eCommerce sales positively contributed approximately 0.9% and 0.7% to comparable sales for fiscal 2019 and 2018 , respectively.

Consistent Operating Discipline
We operate with discipline by managing expenses, optimizing the efficiency of how we work and creating an environment in which we have sustainable lowest cost to serve. We invest in technology and
process improvements to increase productivity, manage inventory and reduce costs. We measure operating discipline through expense leverage, which we define as net sales growing at a faster rate than
operating, selling, general and administrative expenses.

For fiscal 2019 , operating, selling, general and administrative ("operating") expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 48 basis points, when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year.
The primary drivers of the expense leverage were strong sales performance in conjunction with productivity improvements and lapping fiscal 2018 charges discussed in the following paragraph . The
improvements in fiscal 2019 were partially offset by additional investments in eCommerce and technology, as well as a $160 million charge related to a securities class action lawsuit .
For fiscal 2018, operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased 32 basis points, when compared to the previous fiscal year. While our increase in net sales and improving expense management
had a positive impact on our operating expenses as a percentage of net sales, we did not leverage expenses as a result of approximately $0.6 billion in charges related to Sam's Club closures and
discontinued real estate projects, $400 million related to a lump sum bonus paid to associates, $300 million related to Home Office severance, the legal accrual of $283 million related to the FCPA
matter, a charge of $244 million related to discontinued real estate projects in Walmart U.S. and the decisions to exit certain international properties and wind down the first party Brazil eCommerce
operations.
Strategic Capital Allocation
We are allocating more capital to eCommerce, technology, supply chain, and store remodels and less to new store and club openings, when compared to prior years. This allocation aligns with our
initiatives of improving our customer proposition in stores and clubs and a seamless omni-channel experience for our customers . Total fiscal 2019 capital expenditures increased slightly compared to the
prior year; the following table provides additional detail:

Returns
As we execute our financial framework, we believe our return on capital will improve over time. We measure return on capital with our return on assets, return on investment and free cash flow metrics.
We also provide returns in the form of share repurchases and dividends, which are discussed in the Liquidity and Capital Resources section.
Return on Assets and Return on Investment
We include Return on Assets ("ROA"), the most directly comparable measure based on our financial statements presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S.
("GAAP"), and Return on Investment ("ROI") as metrics to assess returns on assets. While ROI is considered a non-GAAP financial measure, management believes ROI is a meaningful metric to share
with investors because it helps investors assess how effectively Walmart is deploying its assets. Trends in ROI can fluctuate over time as management balances long-term strategic initiatives with
possible short-term impacts. ROA was 3.4% and 5.2% for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. For fiscal 2019 , the decline in ROA was primarily due to the decrease in
consolidated net income resulting from the $4.5 billion net loss related to the sale of the majority stake in Walmart Brazil and also the $2.8 billion net unrealized loss on our JD.com investment. For
fiscal 2018 , the decline in ROA was primarily due to the loss on extinguishment of debt and the decrease in operating income. ROI was 14.2% for fiscal 2019 , which was flat compared to fiscal 2018 .
32

We define ROI as adjusted operating income (operating income plus interest income, depreciation and amortization, and rent expense) for the trailing 12 months divided by average invested capital
during that period. We consider average invested capital to be the average of our beginning and ending total assets, plus average accumulated depreciation and average amortization, less average
accounts payable and average accrued liabilities for that period, plus a rent factor equal to the rent for the fiscal year or trailing 12 months multiplied by a factor of 8.
Our calculation of ROI is considered a non-GAAP financial measure because we calculate ROI using financial measures that exclude and include amounts that are included and excluded in the most
directly comparable GAAP financial measure. For example, we exclude the impact of depreciation and amortization from our reported operating income in calculating the numerator of our calculation of
ROI. In addition, we include a factor of 8 for rent expense that estimates the hypothetical capitalization of our operating leases. As mentioned above, we consider ROA to be the financial measure
computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles most directly comparable to our calculation of ROI. ROI differs from ROA (which is consolidated net income for the period
divided by average total assets for the period) because ROI: adjusts operating income to exclude certain expense items and adds interest income; adjusts total assets for the impact of accumulated
depreciation and amortization, accounts payable and accrued liabilities; and incorporates a factor of rent to arrive at total invested capital. Because of the adjustments mentioned above, we believe ROI
more accurately measures how we are deploying our key assets and is more meaningful to investors than ROA.
Although ROI is a standard financial measure, numerous methods exist for calculating a company's ROI. As a result, the method used by management to calculate our ROI may differ from the methods
used by other companies to calculate their ROI. Beginning in fiscal 2020, our calculation of ROI will change upon adoption of ASU 2016-02, Leases , primarily to replace the factor of 8 for rent expense
with US GAAP operating lease assets.
The calculation of ROA and ROI, along with a reconciliation of ROI to the calculation of ROA, the most comparable GAAP financial measure, is as follows:

Free Cash Flow
Free cash flow is considered a non-GAAP financial measure. Management believes, however, that free cash flow, which measures our ability to generate additional cash from our business operations, is
an important financial measure for use in evaluating the Company's financial performance. Free cash flow should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, consolidated net income as a
measure of our performance and net cash provided by operating activities as a measure of our liquidity. See Liquidity and Capital Resources for discussions of GAAP metrics including net cash provided
by operating activities, net cash used in investing activities and net cash used in financing activities.
We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities in a period minus payments for property and equipment made in that period. We had net cash provided by operating activities of
$27.8 billion , $28.3 billion and $31.7 billion for fiscal 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , respectively. We generated free cash flow of $17.4 billion , $18.3 billion and $21.1 billion for fiscal 2019 , 2018 and 2017 ,
respectively. Net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2019 declined when compared to fiscal 2018 primarily due to timing of vendor payments, partially offset by lower tax payments mainly
resulting from U.S. tax reform enacted on December 22, 2017 ("Tax Reform") and the timing of tax payments. Free cash flow for fiscal 2019 declined when compared to fiscal 2018 due to the same
reasons as the decline in net cash provided by operating activities, as well as $0.3 billion in increased capital expenditures . The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities and free cash flow in
fiscal 2018 from fiscal 2017 were primarily due to the timing of tax and other payments, as well as lapping the previous year's improvements in working capital management and the benefit from the
application of tax regulations adopted in fiscal 2017.
Walmart's definition of free cash flow is limited in that it does not represent residual cash flows available for discretionary expenditures due to the fact that the measure does not deduct the payments
required for debt service and other contractual obligations or payments made for business acquisitions. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a measure that provides
supplemental information to our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows .
33

Although other companies report their free cash flow, numerous methods may exist for calculating a company's free cash flow. As a result, the method used by management to calculate our free cash
flow may differ from the methods used by other companies to calculate their free cash flow.
The following table sets forth a reconciliation of free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, to net cash provided by operating activities, which we believe to be the GAAP financial measure most
directly comparable to free cash flow, as well as information regarding net cash used in investing activities and net cash used in financing activities.

Our total revenues, which are mostly comprised of net sales, but also include membership and other income, increased $14.1 billion or 2.8% and $14.5 billion or 3.0% for fiscal 2019 and 2018 ,
respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. Net sales increased $14.6 billion or 2.9% and $14.4 billion or 3.0% for fiscal 2019 and 2018 , respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal
year. For fiscal 2019 , net sales were positively impacted by overall positive comparable sales for Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club segments, along with positive comparable sales in the majority of our
International markets and net sales
from Flipkart, which we acquired in the third quarter of fiscal 2019. Additionally, for fiscal 2019 , the increase in net sales was partially offset by a $4.5 billion decrease in net sales due to club closures
in the Sam's Club segment during fiscal 2018 , a $ 3.1 billion reduction in net sales due to the sale of the majority stake in Walmart Brazil in the International segment, and $0.7 billion of negative
impact from fluctuations in currency exchange rates . For fiscal 2018 , net sales were positively impacted by overall positive comparable sales, the impact from new store openings and sales generated
from eCommerce acquisitions. The positive effect of such factors on our consolidated net sales for fiscal 2018 was partially offset by a reduction in net sales of $1.9 billion due to divesting our
Yihaodian and Suburbia businesses and the $0.5 billion of negative impact from fluctuations in currency exchange rates.
Our gross profit rate decreased 18 and 26 basis points for fiscal 2019 and 2018 , respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. For fiscal 2019 , the decrease was due to the mix effects from
our growing eCommerce business, the consolidation of Flipkart, our planned pricing strategy and increased transportation expenses. For fiscal 2018 , the decrease was primarily due to our planned
pricing strategy and the mix effects from our growing eCommerce business.
Membership and other income decreased for fiscal 2019 , when compared to the previous fiscal year, primarily due to the prior year recognition of a $387 million gain from the sale of Suburbia in our
International Segment. Membership and other income was relatively flat for fiscal 2018 , when compared to the previous fiscal year. While fiscal 2018 included a $387 million gain from the sale of
Suburbia, along with a $47 million gain from a land sale, higher recycling income from our sustainability efforts and higher membership income from increased Plus Member penetration at Sam's Club,
these gains were offset by gains recognized in fiscal 2017 .
For fiscal 2019 , operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 48 basis points, when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year. The primary drivers of the expense leverage
were strong sales performance in conjunction with productivity improvements and lapping fiscal 2018 charges discussed in the following paragraph . The improvements in fiscal 2019 were partially
offset by additional investments in eCommerce and technology, as well as a $160 million charge related to a securities class action lawsuit .
For fiscal 2018, operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased 32 basis points, when compared to the previous fiscal year. While our increase in net sales and improving expense management
had a positive impact on our operating expenses as a percentage of net sales, we did not leverage expenses as a result of approximately $0.6 billion in charges related to Sam's Club closures and
discontinued real estate projects, $400 million related to a lump sum bonus paid to associates, $300 million related to Home Office severance, the legal accrual of $283 million related to the FCPA
matter, a charge of $244 million related to discontinued real estate projects in Walmart U.S. and the decisions to exit certain international properties and wind down the first party Brazil eCommerce
operations.
Other losses were $8.4 billion for fiscal 2019 , primarily the result of the $4.8 billion pre-tax loss on the sale of the majority stake in Walmart Brazil and a $3.5 billion pre-tax decrease in the market
value of our investment in JD.com. Fiscal 2018 results included loss on extinguishment of debt of $3.1 billion .
Our effective income tax rate was 37.4% for fiscal 2019 , 30.4% for fiscal 2018 , and 30.3% for fiscal 2017 . Although the U.S. statutory rate was lowered due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the
"Tax Act"), our effective income tax rate increased in fiscal 2019 primarily because we recognized minimal tax benefit related to the sale of the majority stake in Walmart Brazil and Flipkart's results.
Additionally, our effective income tax rate may also fluctuate as a result of factors including changes in our assessment of certain tax contingencies, valuation allowances, changes in tax law, outcomes
of administrative audits, the impact of discrete items and the mix and size of earnings among our U.S. operations and international operations, which are subject to statutory rates that, beginning in fiscal
2019, are generally higher than the U.S. statutory rate. The reconciliation from the U.S. statutory rate to the effective income tax rates for fiscal 2019 , 2018 and 2017 is presented in Note 9 in the " Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements ."
As a result of the factors discussed above, we reported $7.2 billion and $10.5 billion of consolidated net income for fiscal 2019 and 2018 , respectively, which represents a decrease of $3.3 billion and
$3.8 billion for fiscal 2019 and 2018 , respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. Diluted net income per common share attributable to Walmart ("EPS") was $2.26 , $3.28 and $4.38 for
fiscal 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , respectively.

sales were primarily due to increases in comparable store sales of 3.7% and 2.1% for fiscal 2019 and 2018 , respectively, driven by ticket and traffic growth. Walmart U.S. eCommerce sales positively
contributed approximately 1.3% and 0.7% to comparable sales for fiscal 2019 and 2018 . Additionally, for fiscal 2018 , year-over-year growth in retail square feet further contributed to the year-overyear increase.
Gross profit rate decreased 28 and 24 basis points for fiscal 2019 and 2018 , respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. For fiscal 2019 , the decrease was primarily due to our planned
pricing strategy, increased transportation expenses, and the mix effects from our growing eCommerce business. For fiscal 2018 , the decrease was primarily due to our planned pricing strategy and the
mix effects from our growing eCommerce business. Partially offsetting the negative factors for fiscal 2018 was the positive impact of savings from procuring merchandise.
Operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales decreased 23 basis points for fiscal 2019 and was relatively flat for fiscal 2018 , when compared to the previous fiscal year. The decrease in
fiscal 2019 was primarily due to strong sales performance in conjunction with productivity improvements and the prior year comparable period including charges related to discontinued real estate
projects of $244 million. These improvements more than offset investments in eCommerce, technology and omni-channel initiatives and raising the starting wage rate at the beginning of fiscal 2019.
As a result of the factors discussed above, segment operating income increased $391 million for fiscal 2019 and was relatively flat for fiscal 2018 , respectively, when compared to the same periods in
the previous fiscal year.

Net sales for the Walmart International segment increased $2.8 billion or 2.3% and $1.9 billion or 1.7% for fiscal 2019 and 2018 , respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. For fiscal
2019 , the increase was primarily due to positive comparable sales in the majority of our markets and net sales from Flipkart, which we acquired in the third quarter of fiscal 2019. These increases were
partially offset by a $ 3.1 billion reduction in net sales due to our sale of the majority stake in Walmart Brazil , a $0.7 billion negative impact from fluctuations in currency exchange rates , the continued
wind down of our first party Brazil eCommerce operations and a reduction in net sales of $140 million due to divesting our Suburbia business in the second quarter of fiscal 2018. For fiscal 2018 , the
increase in net sales was due to positive comparable sales in the majority of our markets and the impact of new stores, partially offset by a reduction in net sales of $1.9 billion due to divesting our
Yihaodian and Suburbia businesses and a $0.5 billion negative impact from fluctuations in currency exchange rates.
Gross profit rate decreased 41 and 28 basis points for fiscal 2019 and 2018 , respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. For fiscal 2019 , the decrease was due to Flipkart and strategic price
investments in certain markets. For fiscal 2018 , the decrease in the gross profit rate was primarily due to strategic price investments in certain markets.
Membership and other income decreased 22.4% and 14.0% for fiscal 2019 and 2018 , respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. The decrease in fiscal 2019 was due to the prior year
recognition of a $387 million gain from the sale of Suburbia. While fiscal 2018 included the $387 million gain from the sale of Suburbia and a $47 million gain from a land sale, these gains were less
than gains recognized in fiscal 2017 , which included a $535 million gain from the sale of our Yihaodian business and a $194 million gain from the sale of shopping malls in Chile .
35

Operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales decreased 37 basis points for fiscal 2019 and was flat for 2018 , when compared to the previous fiscal year. The decrease in operating expenses
as a percentage of segment net sales for fiscal 2019 was primarily due to impairment charges in the previous fiscal year of approximately $0.5 billion, which included charges from decisions to exit
certain properties and wind down the first party Brazil eCommerce operations; this decrease in operating expenses was partially offset by the addition of operating expenses from Flipkart in fiscal 2019 .
While fiscal 2018 was benefited by an increase in net sales, this benefit was offset by restructuring and impairment charges in certain markets of approximately $0.5 billion, including charges from
decisions to exit certain properties and wind down the first party Brazil eCommerce operations .
As a result of the factors discussed above, segment operating income decreased $346 million and $508 million for fiscal 2019 and 2018 , respectively.

(1) We believe the "Excluding Fuel" information is useful to investors because it permits investors to understand the effect of the Sam's Club segment's fuel sales on its results of operations, which are impacted by the volatility of fuel
prices. Volatility in fuel prices may continue to impact the operating results of the Sam's Club segment in the future.

Net sales for the Sam's Club segment decreased $1.4 billion or 2.3% for fiscal 2019 and increased $1.9 billion or 3.2% for fiscal 2018 , when compared to the previous fiscal year. For fiscal 2019 , the
decrease was primarily due to a $4.5 billion decrease in net sales resulting from the net closure of 63 clubs during fiscal 2018 , as well as reduced tobacco sales due to our decision to remove tobacco
from certain locations. These decreases were partially offset by increases in comparable sales, which were benefited by transfers of sales from our closed clubs to our existing clubs. Sam's Club
eCommerce sales positively contributed approximately 0.9% to comparable sales for fiscal 2019 . Additional fuel sales of $0.7 billion partially offset the decreases in net sales for fiscal 2019 . For fiscal
2018 , the increase in net sales was primarily due to an increase in comparable sales which were benefited by an increase of $0.7 billion in fuel sales from higher fuel prices. Sam's Club eCommerce
sales positively contributed approximately 0.7% to comparable sales for fiscal 2018 .
Gross profit rate was relatively flat for fiscal 2019 and decreased 44 basis points for fiscal 2018 , when compared to the previous fiscal year. For fiscal 2019 , gross profit rate was benefited by lapping
the impact of markdowns to liquidate inventory related to club closures in fiscal 2018 and decreased tobacco sales in fiscal 2019 , which have lower margins. This benefit to the gross profit rate was
offset by higher transportation costs and eCommerce shipping costs, investments in price and increased shrink in fiscal 2019. For fiscal 2018 , the decrease in gross profit rate was primarily due to the
impact of markdowns to liquidate inventory related to club closures, a reclassification of certain supply expenses from operating expenses to cost of goods sold, increased shrink, increased eCommerce
shipping costs and the investment in cash rewards.
Membership and other income increased 2.6% and 2.3% for fiscal 2019 and 2018 , respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. For fiscal 2019 , the increase was due to an increase of 1.5%
in membership income resulting from increased Plus Member penetration and gains on property sales. These increases were partially offset by lower recycling income when compared to the previous
fiscal year. For fiscal 2018 , the increase in membership and other income was primarily due to higher recycling income from our sustainability efforts and an increase of 1.3% in membership income
resulting from increased Plus Member penetration.
Operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales decreased 99 basis points for fiscal 2019 and increased 83 basis points for fiscal 2018 , when compared to the previous fiscal year. For fiscal
2019 , the decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales was primarily due to a charge of approximately $0.6 billion in the prior year's comparable period related to club closures
and discontinued real estate projects. This charge resulted in the increase in operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales in fiscal 2018 .
36

As a result of the factors discussed above, segment operating income increased $605 million for fiscal 2019 and decreased $713 million f or fiscal 2018 , when compared to the previous fiscal year.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Liquidity
The strength and stability of our operations have historically supplied us with a significant source of liquidity. Our cash flows provided by operating activities, supplemented with our long-term debt and
short-term borrowings, have been sufficient to fund our operations while allowing us to invest in activities that support the long-term growth of our operations. Generally, some or all of the remaining
available cash flow has been used to fund dividends on our common stock and share repurchases. We believe our sources of liquidity will continue to be adequate to fund operations, finance our global
investment and expansion activities, pay dividends and fund our share repurchases for the foreseeable future.

Net cash provided by operating activities was $27.8 billion , $28.3 billion and $31.7 billion for fiscal 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , respectively. Net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2019
declined when compared to the previous fiscal year primarily due to timing of vendor payments, partially offset by lower tax payments mainly resulting from Tax Reform and the timing of tax payments
. The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2018 , when compared to the previous fiscal year, was due to the timing of tax and other payments, as well as lapping the previous
year's improvements in working capital management and the benefit from the application of tax regulations adopted in fiscal 2017.
Cash Equivalents and Working Capital
Cash and cash equivalents were $7.7 billion and $6.8 billion as of January 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. Our working capital deficit was $15.6 billion and $18.9 billion as of January 31, 2019 and
2018 , respectively. We generally operate with a working capital deficit due to our efficient use of cash in funding operations, consistent access to the capital markets and returns provided to our
shareholders in the form of payments of cash dividends and share repurchases. The decreased working capital deficit as of January 31, 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily due to higher current assets
as a result of the consolidation of Flipkart.
Historically, we have used intercompany financing arrangements to make cash available in the country in which it is needed with the minimum cost possible. During fiscal 2019, we repatriated to the
U.S. $5.3 billion of cash at a tax cost of approximately $40 million .
As of January 31, 2019 and 2018 , cash and cash equivalents of $2.8 billion and $1.4 billion , respectively, may not be freely transferable to the U.S. due to local laws or other restrictions. Of the $2.8
billion as of January 31, 2019 , approximately $1.2 billion can only be accessed through dividends or intercompany financing arrangements subject to approval of the Flipkart minority shareholders;
however, this cash is expected to be utilized to fund the operations of Flipkart.

Net cash used in investing activities was $24.0 billion , $9.1 billion and $13.9 billion for fiscal 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , respectively, and generally consisted of payments for business acquisitions and to
expand our eCommerce capabilities, invest in other technologies, remodel existing stores and club and add new stores and clubs. Net cash used in investing activities increased $15.0 billion for fiscal
2019 when compared to the previous fiscal year. This increase was primarily due to the $13.8 billion payment for Flipkart , net of cash acquired, as well as payments for other, smaller acquisitions. Net
cash used in investing activities decreased $4.8 billion for fiscal 2018 when compared to the previous fiscal year. Fiscal 2018 included cash received of $1.0 billion from the sale of Suburbia in Mexico,
while fiscal 2017 included our acquisition of Jet.com, Inc. ("jet.com") for $2.4 billion and our purchase of $1.9 billion of shares in JD.com ("JD"). Refer to Note 13 to our Consolidated Financial
Statements for further details on our acquisition of jet.com and investment in JD. Additionally, refer to the " Strategic Capital Allocation " section in our Company Performance Metrics for capital

Growth Activities
For the fiscal year ending January 31, 2020 ("fiscal 2020 "), we project capital expenditures will be approximately $11.0 billion. In fiscal 2020 , we expect to add approximately 300 new stores in
Walmart International, primarily in Mexico, Central America and China, and add less than 10 stores in Walmart U.S.

(19,072)

Net cash used in financing activities generally consists of transactions related to our short-term and long-term debt, financing obligations, dividends paid and the repurchase of Company stock.
Transactions with noncontrolling interest shareholders are also classified as cash flows from financing activities. Fiscal 2019 net cash used in financing activities decreased $17.3 billion when compared
to the same period in the previous fiscal year. The decrease was primarily due to the $15.9 billion of net proceeds received from the issuance of long-term debt to fund a portion of the purchase price for
Flipkart and for general corporate purposes, as well as a decrease in share repurchases due to the suspension of repurchases in anticipation of the Flipkart announcement. Fiscal 2018 net cash used in
financing activities increased $0.8 billion for fiscal 2018 when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year. The increase was primarily due to premiums paid for early extinguishment of
debt. Further discussion of financing activities is provided by major categories below.
Short-term Borrowings
Net cash flows provided by short-term borrowings were relatively flat in fiscal 2019 and increased $4.1 billion in fiscal 2018 , when compared to the balance at the end of the previous fiscal year. We
generally utilize the liquidity provided by short-term borrowings to provide funding for our operations, dividend payments, share repurchases, capital expenditures and other cash requirements. For fiscal
2018 , the additional cash provided by short-term borrowings was primarily due to the timing of our January 2018 debt extinguishment.

Our total dividend payments were $6.1 billion , $6.1 billion and $6.2 billion for fiscal 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , respectively. The Board of Directors approved, effective February 19, 2019 , the fiscal 2020
annual dividend of $2.12 per share, an increase over the fiscal 2019 annual dividend of $2.08 per share. For fiscal 2020 , the annual dividend will be paid in four quarterly installments of $0.53 per share,

Company Share Repurchase Program
From time to time, the Company repurchases shares of its common stock under share repurchase programs authorized by the Company's Board of Directors. All repurchases made during fiscal 2019
were made under the current $20 billion share repurchase program approved in October 2017, which has no expiration date or other restrictions limiting the period over which the Company can make
share repurchases. As of January 31, 2019 , authorization for $11.3 billion of share repurchases remained under the share repurchase program. Any repurchased shares are constructively retired and
returned to an unissued status.
We regularly review share repurchase activity and consider several factors in determining when to execute share repurchases, including, among other things, current cash needs, capacity for leverage,
cost of borrowings, our results of operations and the market price of our common stock. We anticipate that a majority of the ongoing share repurchase program will be funded through the Company's free
cash flow. The following table provides, on a settlement date basis, the number of shares repurchased, average price paid per share and total amount paid for share repurchases for fiscal 2019 , 2018 and
2017 :

Share repurchases decreased for fiscal 2019 and were relatively flat for fiscal 2018 , respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. The decrease in fiscal 2019 was due to the suspension of
repurchases in anticipation of the announcement of the Flipkart acquisition. Repurchases of Company stock returned to a more normalized level in the latter half of fiscal 2019.
Capital Resources
We believe cash flows from operations, our current cash position and access to capital markets will continue to be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs, which include funding seasonal
buildups in merchandise inventories and funding our capital expenditures, acquisitions, dividend payments and share repurchases.
We have strong commercial paper and long-term debt ratings that have enabled and should continue to enable us to refinance our debt as it becomes due at favorable rates in capital markets. As of
January 31, 2019 , the ratings assigned to our commercial paper and rated series of our outstanding long-term debt were as follows:
Rating agency
Standard & Poor's
Moody's Investors Service
Fitch Ratings

Long-term debt

A-1+

Credit rating agencies review their ratings periodically and, therefore, the credit ratings assigned to us by each agency may be subject to revision at any time. Accordingly, we are not able to predict
whether our current credit ratings will remain consistent over time. Factors that could affect our credit ratings include changes in our operating performance, the general economic environment,
conditions in the retail industry, our financial position, including our total debt and capitalization, and changes in our business strategy. Any downgrade of our credit ratings by a credit rating agency
could increase our future borrowing costs or impair our ability to access capital and credit markets on terms commercially acceptable to us. In addition, any downgrade of our current short-term credit
ratings could impair our ability to access the commercial paper markets with the same flexibility that we have experienced historically, potentially requiring us to rely more heavily on more expensive
types of debt financing. The credit rating agency ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold our commercial paper or debt securities. Each rating may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any
time by the assigning rating organization and should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Moreover, each credit rating is specific to the security to which it applies.

"Long-term debt" includes the fair value of our derivatives designated as fair value hedges.
"Capital lease and financing obligations" represents undiscounted aggregate minimum annual rentals, which are recorded on the balance sheet at present value. Refer to Note 11 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for more
information.
Represents minimum contractual obligation for non-cancelable leases with initial or remaining terms greater than 12 months as of January 31, 2019 .

Under the terms of the sale of the majority stake of Walmart Brazil, we agreed to indemnify Advent for certain pre-closing tax and legal contingencies and other matters for up to R$2.3 billion , adjusted
for interest based on the Brazilian interbank deposit rate. As of January 31, 2019 , the indemnification liability recorded was $0.8 billion and included in deferred income taxes and other in the
Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet.
Additionally, we have $15.0 billion of various undrawn committed lines of credit in the U.S. and approximately $2.8 billion of various undrawn committed lines of credit outside of the U.S. which, if
drawn upon, would be included in the current liabilities section of the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Estimated interest payments are based on our principal amounts and expected maturities of all debt outstanding as of January 31, 2019 , and assumes interest rates remain at current levels for our variable
rate debt.
Purchase obligations include legally binding contracts, such as firm commitments for inventory and utility purchases, as well as commitments to make capital expenditures, software acquisition and
license commitments and legally binding service contracts. For the purposes of the above table, contractual obligations for the purchase of goods or services are defined as agreements that are
enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of
the transaction. Contracts that specify the Company will purchase all or a portion of its requirements of a specific product or service from a supplier, but do not include a fixed or minimum quantity, are
excluded from the table above. Accordingly, purchase orders for inventory are not included in the table above as purchase orders represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements. Our
purchase orders are based on our current inventory needs and are fulfilled by our suppliers within short time periods. We also enter into contracts for outsourced services; however, the obligations under
these contracts are not significant and the contracts generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty.
The expected timing for payment discussed above is estimated based on current information. Timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the timing of receipt of goods
or services or changes to agreed-upon amounts for some obligations.
In addition to the amounts shown in the table above, $1.3 billion of unrecognized tax benefits are considered uncertain tax positions and have been recorded as liabilities. The timing of the payment, if
any, associated with these liabilities is uncertain. Refer to Note 9 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion of unrecognized tax benefits.
Off Balance Sheet Arrangements
As of January 31, 2019 , we had no off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future material effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of
operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.

Summary of Critical Accounting Estimates
Management strives to report our financial results in a clear and understandable manner, although in some cases accounting and disclosure rules are complex and require us to use technical terminology.
In preparing the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements, we follow accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. These principles require us to make certain estimates and apply judgments
that affect our financial position and results of operations as reflected in our financial statements. These judgments and estimates are based on past events and expectations of future outcomes. Actual
results may differ from our estimates.
Management continually reviews our accounting policies, how they are applied and how they are reported and disclosed in our financial statements. Following is a summary of our critical accounting
estimates and how they are applied in preparation of the financial statements.
Inventories
We value inventories at the lower of cost or market as determined primarily by the retail inventory method of accounting, using the last-in, first-out ("LIFO") method for Walmart U.S. segment's
inventories. The inventory at the Sam's Club segment is valued using the weighted-average cost LIFO method. When necessary, we record a LIFO provision for the estimated annual effect of inflation,
and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year-end. Our LIFO provision is calculated based on inventory levels, markup rates and internally generated retail price indices. As a
measure of sensitivity, a 1% increase to our retail price indices would not have resulted in a decrease to the carrying value of inventory. As of January 31, 2019 and 2018 , our inventories valued at LIFO
approximated those inventories as if they were valued at FIFO.
Impairment of Assets
We evaluate long-lived assets for indicators of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Management's judgments regarding the
existence of impairment indicators are based on market conditions and financial performance. The evaluation of long-lived assets is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, which is
generally at the individual store level. The variability of these factors depends on a number of conditions, including uncertainty about future events and changes in demographics. Thus, our accounting
estimates may change from period to period. These factors could cause management to conclude that indicators of impairment exist and require impairment tests be performed, which could result in
management determining the value of long-lived assets is impaired, resulting in a write-down of the related long-lived assets. While fiscal 2019 included a pre-tax loss of $4.8 billion related to the sale
of the majority stake in Walmart Brazil, which included full impairment of all related-assets, there were no other material impairment charges for fiscal 2019. As a measure of sensitivity, fiscal 2019
impairment would not change materially with a 10% decrease in the undiscounted cash flows for the stores or clubs with indicators of impairment. For fiscal 2018, although impairment charges were
$1.4 billion, these charges primarily related to restructuring activities described in Note 14 , as well as discontinued real estate projects in the U.S. and decisions to exit certain international properties .
Impairment charges not related to restructuring activities or decisions to exit properties for fiscal 2019 and 2018 were not material.

Business Combinations, Goodwill, and Acquired Intangible Assets
We account for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires that once control is obtained, all the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including amounts
attributable to noncontrolling interests, be recorded at their respective fair values at the date of acquisition. The determination of fair values of identifiable assets and liabilities requires estimates and the
use of valuation techniques when market value is not readily available. For intangible assets acquired in a business combination, we typically use the income method. Significant estimates in valuing
certain intangible assets include, but are not limited to, the amount and timing of future cash flows, growth rates, discount rates and useful lives. The excess of the purchase price over fair values of
identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill.
Goodwill is assigned to the reporting unit which consolidates the acquisition. Components within the same reportable segment are aggregated and deemed a single reporting unit if the components have
similar economic characteristics. As of January 31, 2019 , our reporting units consisted of Walmart U.S., Walmart International and Sam's Club. Goodwill and other indefinite-lived acquired intangible
assets are not amortized, but are evaluated for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the value of a certain asset may be impaired. Generally, this evaluation
begins with a qualitative assessment to determine whether a quantitative impairment test is necessary. If we determine, after performing an assessment based on the qualitative factors, that the fair value
of the reporting unit is more likely than not less than the carrying amount, or that a fair value of the reporting unit substantially in excess of the carrying amount cannot be assured, then a quantitative
impairment test would be performed. The quantitative test for impairment requires management to make judgments relating to future cash flows, growth rates and economic and market conditions. These
evaluations are based on determining the fair value of a reporting unit or asset using a valuation method such as discounted cash flow or a relative, market-based approach. Historically, our reporting
units and other indefinite-lived acquired intangible assets have generated sufficient returns to recover the cost of goodwill and other indefinite-lived acquired intangible assets. Because of the nature of
the factors used in these tests, if different conditions occur in future periods, future operating results could be materially impacted. For approximately $300 million of certain acquired indefinite-lived
intangible assets, the fair value approximated the carrying value; any deterioration in the fair value may result in an impairment charge.
Income Taxes
Income taxes have a significant effect on our net earnings. We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Accordingly, the determination of our provision for income
taxes requires significant judgment, the use of estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. Our effective income tax rate is affected by many factors, including changes in our
assessment of certain tax contingencies, increases and decreases in valuation allowances, changes in tax law, outcomes of administrative audits, the impact of discrete items and the mix of earnings
among our U.S. and international operations where the statutory rates are generally lower than the U.S. statutory rate, and may fluctuate as a result.
Our tax returns are routinely audited and settlements of issues raised in these audits sometimes affect our tax provisions. The benefits of uncertain tax positions are recorded in our financial statements
only after determining a more likely than not probability that the uncertain tax positions will withstand challenge, if any, from taxing authorities. When facts and circumstances change, we reassess these
probabilities and record any changes in the financial statements as appropriate. We account for uncertain tax positions by determining the minimum recognition threshold that a tax position is required to
meet before being recognized in the financial statements. This determination requires the use of significant judgment in evaluating our tax positions and assessing the timing and amounts of deductible
and taxable items.
Deferred tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable on taxable income in future years. Such assets arise because of temporary differences between the financial reporting and
tax bases of assets and liabilities, as well as from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets are evaluated for future realization and reduced by a valuation allowance to the
extent that a portion is not more likely than not to be realized. Many factors are considered when assessing whether it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized, including recent
cumulative earnings, expectations of future taxable income, carryforward periods and other relevant quantitative and qualitative factors. The recoverability of the deferred tax assets is evaluated by
assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, including reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies. This
evaluation relies heavily on estimates.
On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the "Tax Act") was enacted and contains significant changes to U.S. income tax law. Effective beginning January 2018, the Tax Act reduced
the U.S. statutory tax rate from 35% to 21% and created new taxes on foreign-sourced earnings and related-party payments. As discussed in Note 9 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, we
completed our accounting for the tax effects of the Tax Act in fiscal 2019. As further guidance is issued by the U.S. Treasury Department, the IRS, and other standard–setting bodies, any resulting
changes to our estimates will be treated in accordance with the relevant accounting guidance.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Market Risk
In addition to the risks inherent in our operations, we are exposed to certain market risks, including changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates and the fair value of our equity investment in
JD.com.
The analysis presented below for each of our market risk sensitive instruments is based on a hypothetical scenario used to calibrate potential risk and does not represent our view of future market
changes. The effect of a change in a particular assumption is calculated without adjusting any other assumption. In reality, however, a change in one factor could cause a change in another, which may
magnify or negate other sensitivities.
Interest Rate Risk
We are exposed to changes in interest rates as a result of our short-term borrowings and long-term debt. We hedge a portion of our interest rate risk by managing the mix of fixed and variable rate debt
and by entering into interest rate swaps. For fiscal 2019 , the net fair value of our interest rate swaps increased $13 million primarily due to fluctuations in market interest rates.
The table below provides information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates. For long-term debt, the table represents the principal cash flows and related weightedaverage interest rates by expected maturity dates. For interest rate swaps, the table represents the contractual cash flows and weighted-average interest rates by the contractual maturity date, unless
otherwise noted. The notional amounts are used to calculate contractual cash flows to be exchanged under the contracts. The weighted-average variable rates are based upon prevailing market rates as of
January 31, 2019 .

The long-term debt amounts in the table exclude the Company's derivatives classified as fair value hedges.

As of January 31, 2019 , our variable rate borrowings, including the effect of our commercial paper and interest rate swaps, represented 22% of our total short-term and long-term debt. Based on
January 31, 2019 debt levels, a 100 basis point change in prevailing market rates would cause our annual interest costs to change by approximately $110 million .
Foreign Currency Risk
We are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates as a result of our net investments and operations in countries other than the U.S, as well our foreign-currency-denominated long-term debt. For
fiscal 2019 , movements in currency exchange rates and the related impact on the translation of the balance sheets of the Company's subsidiaries in the UK, Chile, and Canada were the primary cause of
the $2.1 billion loss in the currency translation and other category of accumulated other comprehensive loss.
We hedge a portion of our foreign currency risk by entering into currency swaps. The aggregate fair value of these swaps was in an asset position of $62 million and $413 million as of January 31, 2019
and January 31, 2018 , respectively. The change in the fair value of these swaps was due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, primarily the strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to other
currencies in fiscal 2019 . A hypothetical 10% change in the currency exchange rates underlying these swaps from the market rate as of January 31, 2019 would have resulted in a change in the value of
the swaps of $515 million . A hypothetical 10% change in interest rates underlying these swaps from the market rates in effect as of January 31, 2019 would have resulted in a change in the value of the
swaps of $13 million .
43

In addition to currency swaps, we also hedge a portion of our foreign currency risk by designating foreign-currency-denominated long-term debt as nonderivative hedges of net investments of certain of
our foreign operations. We had outstanding long-term debt of £1.7 billion as of January 31, 2019 and January 31, 2018 that was designated as a hedge of our net investment in the United Kingdom. As of
January 31, 2019 , a hypothetical 10% increase or decrease in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to the British pound would have resulted in a change in the value of the debt of $201 million . In
addition, we had outstanding long-term debt of ¥180 billion as of January 31, 2019 and January 31, 2018 that was designated as a hedge of our net investment in Japan. As of January 31, 2019 , a
hypothetical 10% change in value of the U.S. dollar relative to the Japanese yen would have resulted in a change in the value of the debt of $150 million .
In certain countries, we also enter into immaterial foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the purchase and payment of purchase commitments denominated in non-functional currencies.
Investment Risk
We are exposed to changes in the JD.com ("JD") stock price as a result of our equity investment in JD. Since February 1, 2018, when we adopted the new financial instrument accounting standard, the
change in fair value recorded within other gains and losses resulted in a loss of $3.5 billion due to a decrease in the stock price of JD. As of January 31, 2019 , the fair value of our equity investment in
JD was $3.6 billion .

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Walmart Inc.
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Walmart Inc. (the Company) as of January 31, 2019 and 2018 , the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income,
shareholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 31, 2019 , and the related notes (collectively referred to as the "consolidated financial statements"). In our
opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at January 31, 2019 and 2018 , and the results of its operations and its cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 31, 2019 , in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of
January 31, 2019 , based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our
report dated March 28, 2019 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
Adoption of ASU No. 2016-01
As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed its method of measuring certain equity investments to fair value and recognizing the change in fair value in net
income effective February 1, 2018, due to the adoption of Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2016-01, Financial Instruments-Overall (Topic 825) .
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public
accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations
of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether
due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Walmart Inc.
Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited Walmart Inc.'s internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2019 , based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Walmart Inc. (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal
control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2019 , based on the COSO criteria.
As indicated in the accompanying Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management’s assessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting did
not include the internal controls of Flipkart Private Limited (“Flipkart”), except for the recognition of goodwill and intangible assets that were included in management’s assessment. Flipkart is included
in the 2019 consolidated financial statements of the Company and constituted approximately 2% of the Company’s total assets as of January 31, 2019 after excluding goodwill and intangible assets
recorded and approximately 1% of the Company’s net sales for the year ended January 31, 2019. Accordingly, our audit of internal control over financial reporting of the Company also did not include
an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of Flipkart, except for the recognition of goodwill and intangible assets.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Walmart Inc. as
of January 31, 2019 and 2018 , the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 31, 2019
, and the related notes and our report dated March 28, 2019 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
Basis for Opinion
The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting
included in the accompanying Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our
audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable
rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal
control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness
of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our
opinion.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for
external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the
maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in
accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or
disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to
the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Walmart Inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
General
Walmart Inc. ("Walmart" or the "Company") helps people around the world save money and live better – anytime and anywhere – by providing the opportunity to shop in retail stores and through
eCommerce. Through innovation, the Company is striving to continuously improve a customer-centric experience that seamlessly integrates eCommerce and retail stores in an omni-channel offering that
saves time for its customers. Each week, the Company serves over 275 million customers who visit its more than 11,300 stores and numerous eCommerce websites under 58 banners in 27 countries.
The Company's operations comprise three reportable segments: Walmart U.S., Walmart International and Sam's Club.
Principles of Consolidation
The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Walmart and its subsidiaries as of and for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2019 ("fiscal 2019 "), January 31, 2018 ("fiscal 2018 ") and
January 31, 2017 ("fiscal 2017 "). Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The Company consolidates variable interest entities where it has been determined that
the Company is the primary beneficiary of those entities' operations. Investments for which the Company exercises significant influence but does not have control are accounted for under the equity
method. These variable interest entities and equity method investments are immaterial to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.
The Company's Consolidated Financial Statements are based on a fiscal year ending on January 31 for the United States ("U.S.") and Canadian operations. The Company consolidates all other operations
generally using a one-month lag and based on a calendar year. There were no significant intervening events during the month of January 2019 related to the operations consolidated using a lag that
materially affected the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Use of Estimates
The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Those principles require management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities. Management's estimates and assumptions also affect the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and
the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results may differ from those estimates.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
The Company considers investments with a maturity when purchased of three months or less to be cash equivalents. All credit card, debit card and electronic transfer transactions that process in less than
seven days are classified as cash and cash equivalents. The amounts due from banks for these transactions classified as cash and cash equivalents totaled $1.4 billion and $1.6 billion as of January 31,
2019 and 2018 , respectively.
The Company's cash balances are held in various locations around the world. Substantially all of the Company's $7.7 billion and $6.8 billion of cash and cash equivalents as of January 31, 2019 and
January 31, 2018 were held outside of the U.S. Cash and cash equivalents held outside of the U.S. are generally utilized to support liquidity needs in the Company's non-U.S. operations.
The Company uses intercompany financing arrangements in an effort to ensure cash can be made available in the country in which it is needed with the minimum cost possible. During fiscal 2019, the
Company repatriated to the U.S. $5.3 billion of cash at a tax cost of approximately $40 million .
As of January 31, 2019 and 2018 , cash and cash equivalents of approximately $2.8 billion and $1.4 billion , respectively, may not be freely transferable to the U.S. due to local laws or other restrictions.
Of the $2.8 billion as of January 31, 2019 , approximately $1.2 billion can only be accessed through dividends or intercompany financing arrangements subject to approval of Flipkart Private Limited
("Flipkart") minority shareholders; however, this cash is expected to be utilized to fund the operations of Flipkart.
Restricted Cash
In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-18, Statement of Cash Flows–Restricted Cash (Topic 230) , which requires restricted cash to be included with cash and cash equivalents when
reconciling the beginning and ending amounts on the statement of cash flows. The Company adopted this ASU on February 1, 2018. Restricted cash held outside of cash and cash equivalents was $34
million as of January 31, 2019 , primarily recorded in prepaid expenses and other in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, and $300 million as of January 31, 2018 , primarily recorded in other long-term
assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
53

Receivables
Receivables are stated at their carrying values, net of a reserve for doubtful accounts, and are primarily due from the following: insurance companies resulting from pharmacy sales; banks for customer
credit and debit cards and electronic bank transfers that take in excess of seven days to process; governments for income taxes; suppliers for marketing or incentive programs; and real estate transactions.
Inventories
The Company values inventories at the lower of cost or market as determined primarily by the retail inventory method of accounting, using the last-in, first-out ("LIFO") method for Walmart U.S.
segment's inventories. The inventory at the Walmart International segment is valued primarily by the retail inventory method of accounting, using the first-in, first-out ("FIFO") method. The retail
inventory method of accounting results in inventory being valued at the lower of cost or market, since permanent markdowns are immediately recorded as a reduction of the retail value of inventory. The
inventory at the Sam's Club segment is valued using the weighted-average cost LIFO method. As of January 31, 2019 and January 31, 2018 , the Company's inventories valued at LIFO approximated
those inventories as if they were valued at FIFO.
Assets Held for Sale
Assets held for sale represent components and businesses that meet accounting requirements to be classified as held for sale and are presented as single asset and liability amounts in the Company's
financial statements with a valuation allowance, if necessary, to recognize the net carrying amount at the lower of cost or fair value, less costs to sell. The Company reviews all businesses and assets
held for sale each reporting period to determine whether the existing carrying amounts are fully recoverable in comparison to estimated fair values. As of January 31, 2019 and January 31, 2018 ,
immaterial amounts for assets and liabilities held for sale were classified in prepaid expenses and other and accrued liabilities, respectively, in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are initially recorded at cost. Gains or losses on disposition are recognized as earned or incurred. Costs of major improvements are capitalized, while costs of normal repairs and
maintenance are expensed as incurred. The following table summarizes the Company's property and equipment balances and includes the estimated useful lives that are generally used to depreciate the
assets on a straight-line basis:

Leasehold improvements are depreciated or amortized over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the remaining expected lease term. Total depreciation and amortization expense for
property and equipment, property under financing obligations, property under capital leases and intangible assets for fiscal 2019 , 2018 and 2017 was $10.7 billion , $10.5 billion and $10.1 billion ,
respectively.
Leases
The Company leases land, buildings, fixtures and equipment and transportation equipment. The Company estimates the expected lease term by assuming the exercise of renewal options where an
economic penalty exists that would preclude the abandonment of the lease at the end of the initial non-cancelable term and the exercise of such renewal is at the sole discretion of the Company. The
expected lease term is used in the determination of whether a store or club lease is a capital or operating lease and in the calculation of straight-line rent expense. Additionally, the useful life of leasehold
improvements is limited by the expected lease term or the economic life of the asset, whichever is shorter. If significant expenditures are made for leasehold improvements late in the expected lease term
and renewal is reasonably assured, the useful life of the leasehold improvement is limited to the end of the renewal period or economic life of the asset, whichever is shorter. Rent abatements and
escalations are considered in the calculation of minimum lease payments in the Company's capital lease tests and in determining straight-line rent expense for operating leases.
54

The Company is often involved in the construction of its leased stores. In certain cases, payments made for certain structural components included in the lessor's construction of the leased assets result in
the Company being deemed the owner of the leased assets for accounting purposes. As a result, the payments, regardless of the significance, are automatic indicators of ownership and require the
Company to capitalize the lessor's total project cost with a corresponding financing obligation. Upon completion of the lessor's project, the Company performs a sale-leaseback analysis to determine if
these assets and the related financing obligation can be derecognized from the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. If the Company is deemed to have "continuing involvement," the leased assets
and the related financing obligation remain on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets and are generally amortized over the lease term. At the end of the lease term, including exercise of any
renewal options, the net remaining financing obligation over the net carrying value of the fixed asset will be recognized as a non-cash gain.
Long-Lived Assets
Long-lived assets are initially recorded at cost. Management reviews long-lived assets for indicators of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may
not be recoverable. The evaluation is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, which is at the individual store or club level. Undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the
related assets are estimated over the assets' useful lives based on updated projections. If the evaluation indicates that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable, any potential impairment is
measured based upon the fair value of the related asset or asset group as determined by an appropriate market appraisal or other valuation technique.
Goodwill and Other Acquired Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations and is allocated to the appropriate reporting unit when acquired. Other acquired
intangible assets are stated at the fair value acquired as determined by a valuation technique commensurate with the intended use of the related asset. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are
not amortized; rather, they are evaluated for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the value of the asset may be impaired. Definite-lived intangible assets
are considered long-lived assets and are amortized on a straight-line basis over the periods that expected economic benefits will be provided.
Goodwill is assigned to the reporting unit which consolidates the acquisition. Components within the same reportable segment are aggregated and deemed a single reporting unit if the components have
similar economic characteristics. As of January 31, 2019 , the Company's reporting units consisted of Walmart U.S., Walmart International and Sam's Club. Goodwill is evaluated for impairment using
either a qualitative or quantitative approach for each of the Company's reporting units. Generally, a qualitative assessment is first performed to determine whether a quantitative goodwill impairment test
is necessary. If management determines, after performing an assessment based on the qualitative factors, that the fair value of the reporting unit is more likely than not less than the carrying amount, or
that a fair value of the reporting unit substantially in excess of the carrying amount cannot be assured, then a quantitative goodwill impairment test would be required. The quantitative test for goodwill
impairment is performed by determining the fair value of the related reporting units. Fair value is measured based on the discounted cash flow method and relative market-based approaches. After
evaluation, management determined the fair value of each reporting unit is greater than the carrying amount and, accordingly, the Company has not recorded any impairment charges related to goodwill.

Intangible assets are included in other long-term assets in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. These assets are evaluated for impairment based on their fair values using valuation techniques
which are updated annually based on the most recent variables and assumptions. There were no significant impairment charges related to intangible assets for fiscal 2019 , 2018 and 2017 .
55

Fair Value Measurement
In January 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2016-01, Financial Instruments–Overall (Topic 825) , which updated certain
aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of financial instruments ("ASU 2016-01"). The Company adopted this ASU on February 1, 2018, which primarily impacted the
Company's accounting for its investment in JD.com, Inc. ("JD") and resulted in a positive adjustment to retained earnings of approximately $2.6 billion , net of tax, based on the market value of the
Company's investment in JD as of January 31, 2018. The adoption required prospective changes in fair value of the Company's investment in JD to be recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Income,
which the Company classifies in other gains and losses.
The Company records and discloses certain financial and non-financial assets and liabilities at fair value. The fair value of an asset is the price at which the asset could be sold in an orderly transaction
between unrelated, knowledgeable and willing parties able to engage in the transaction. The fair value of a liability is the amount that would be paid to transfer the liability to a new obligor in a
transaction between such parties, not the amount that would be paid to settle the liability with the creditor.
Self Insurance Reserves
The Company self-insures a number of risks, including, but not limited to, workers' compensation, general liability, auto liability, product liability and certain employee-related healthcare benefits .
Standard actuarial procedures and data analysis are used to estimate the liabilities associated with these risks as of the balance sheet date on an undiscounted basis. The recorded liabilities reflect the
ultimate cost for claims incurred but not paid and any estimable administrative run-out expenses related to the processing of these outstanding claim payments. On a regular basis, the liabilities are
evaluated for appropriateness with claims reserve valuations. To limit exposure to some risks, the Company maintains insurance coverage with varying limits and retentions, including stop-loss
insurance coverage for workers' compensation, general liability and auto liability.
Derivatives
The Company uses derivatives for hedging purposes to manage its exposure to changes in interest and currency exchange rates, as well as to maintain an appropriate mix of fixed- and variable-rate debt.
Use of derivatives in hedging programs subjects the Company to certain risks, such as market and credit risks. Market risk represents the possibility that the value of the derivatives will change. In a
hedging relationship, the change in the value of the derivative is offset to a great extent by the change in the value of the underlying hedged item. Credit risk related to a derivative represents the
possibility that the counterparty will not fulfill the terms of the contract. Credit risk is monitored through established approval procedures, including setting concentration limits by counterparty,
reviewing credit ratings and requiring collateral from the counterparty when appropriate. The Company only enters into derivatives with counterparties rated "A-" or better by nationally recognized
credit rating agencies. Subsequent to entering into derivatives, the Company regularly monitors the credit ratings of its counterparties. The notional, or contractual, amount of the Company's derivatives
is used to measure interest to be paid or received and does not represent the Company's exposure due to credit risk.
The contractual terms of the Company's derivatives closely mirror those of the hedged items, providing a high degree of risk reduction and correlation. Contracts that are effective at meeting the risk
reduction and correlation criteria are recorded using hedge accounting. If a derivative is recorded using hedge accounting, depending on the nature of the hedge, changes in fair value will either be offset
against the change in fair value of the hedged assets, liabilities or firm commitments through earnings or be recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss until the hedged item is recognized in
earnings. Any hedge ineffectiveness is immediately recognized in earnings. The Company's net investment and cash flow hedges are highly effective and the ineffective portion has not been, and is not
expected to be, significant. Derivatives that do not meet the criteria for hedge accounting, or contracts for which the Company has not elected hedge accounting, are recorded at fair value with unrealized
gains or losses reported in earnings during the period of the change.
Fair Value Hedges
The Company is a party to receive fixed-rate, pay variable-rate interest rate swaps that the Company uses to hedge the fair value of fixed-rate debt. The notional amounts are used to measure interest to
be paid or received and do not represent the Company's exposure due to credit loss. The Company's interest rate swaps that receive fixed-interest rate payments and pay variable-interest rate payments
are designated as fair value hedges. As the specific terms and notional amounts of the derivatives match those of the fixed-rate debt being hedged, the derivatives are assumed to be perfectly effective
hedges. Changes in the fair values of these derivatives are recorded in earnings, but are offset by corresponding changes in the fair values of the hedged items, also recorded in earnings, and, accordingly,
do not impact the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income. These derivatives will mature on dates ranging from October 2020 to April 2024 .
56

Net Investment Hedges
The Company is a party to cross-currency interest rate swaps that the Company uses to hedge its net investments. The agreements are contracts to exchange fixed-rate payments in one currency for
fixed-rate payments in another currency. All changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss, offsetting the currency translation adjustment of the
related investment that is also recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss. These derivatives will mature on dates ranging from July 2020 to February 2030 .
The Company has issued foreign-currency-denominated long-term debt as hedges of net investments of certain of its foreign operations. These foreign-currency-denominated long-term debt issuances
are designated and qualify as nonderivative hedging instruments. Accordingly, the foreign currency translation of these debt instruments is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss, offsetting
the foreign currency translation adjustment of the related net investment that is also recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss.
Cash Flow Hedges
The Company is a party to receive fixed-rate, pay fixed-rate cross-currency interest rate swaps to hedge the currency exposure associated with the forecasted payments of principal and interest of certain
non-U.S. denominated debt. The swaps are designated as cash flow hedges of the currency risk related to payments on the non-U.S. denominated debt. The effective portion of changes in the fair value
of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges of foreign exchange risk is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss and is subsequently reclassified into earnings in the period that the hedged
forecasted transaction affects earnings. The hedged items are recognized foreign currency-denominated liabilities that are re-measured at spot exchange rates each period, and the assessment of
effectiveness (and measurement of any ineffectiveness) is based on total changes in the related derivative's cash flows. As a result, the amount reclassified into earnings each period includes an amount
that offsets the related transaction gain or loss arising from that re-measurement and the adjustment to earnings for the period's allocable portion of the initial spot-forward difference associated with the
hedging instrument. These derivatives will mature on dates ranging from April 2022 to March 2034 .
Financial Statement Presentation
Realized derivative gains and losses are recorded in interest, net, in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income. Although subject to master netting arrangements, the Company does not offset
derivative assets and liabilities in its Consolidated Balance Sheets. Derivatives with an unrealized gain are recorded in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets as either current or non-current assets,
based on maturity date, and derivatives with an unrealized loss are recorded as either current or non-current liabilities, based on maturity date. Refer to Note 7 for the net presentation of the Company's
derivatives. Additionally, the Company records cash collateral received as amounts due to the counterparties exclusive of any derivative asset and records cash collateral it posts with counterparties as
amounts receivable from those counterparties exclusive of any derivative liability.
Income Taxes
Income taxes are accounted for under the balance sheet method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the
financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases ("temporary differences"). Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in
effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rate is recognized in income in the
period that includes the enactment date.
Deferred tax assets are evaluated for future realization and reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent that a portion is not more likely than not to be realized. Many factors are considered when
assessing whether it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized, including recent cumulative earnings, expectations of future taxable income, carryforward periods, and other
relevant quantitative and qualitative factors. The recoverability of the deferred tax assets is evaluated by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, including reversal of
taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies. These sources of income rely heavily on estimates.
The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act contains a provision which subjects a US parent of a foreign subsidiary to current US tax on its global intangible low–taxed income (“GILTI”). The GILTI income is eligible
for a deduction, which lowers the effective tax rate to 10.5% for calendar years 2018 through 2025 and 13.125% after 2025. The Company will report the tax impact of GILTI as a period cost when
incurred. Accordingly, the Company is not providing deferred taxes for basis differences expected to reverse as GILTI.
In determining the provision for income taxes, an annual effective income tax rate is used based on annual income, permanent differences between book and tax income, and statutory income tax rates.
Discrete events such as audit settlements or changes in tax laws are recognized in the period in which they occur.
57

The Company records a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The Company records interest and penalties related to
unrecognized tax benefits in interest expense and operating, selling, general and administrative expenses, respectively, in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income. Refer to Note 9 for
additional income tax disclosures.
In February 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-02, Income Statement–Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive
Income ("ASU 2018-02"). This ASU provides that the stranded tax effects from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 ("Tax Act") in accumulated other comprehensive loss may be reclassified to retained
earnings. The Company adopted this ASU on February 1, 2018, which resulted in an immaterial negative adjustment to retained earnings.
Revenue Recognition
In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) . This ASU is a comprehensive new revenue recognition model that requires a company to recognize
revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to a customer at an amount that reflects the consideration it expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. The Company adopted this ASU
on February 1, 2018, using the modified retrospective approach and applied this ASU only to contracts not completed as of February 1, 2018. The accounting policies and other disclosures are below as
well as the disclosure of disaggregated revenues in Note 15 . The impact of adopting this ASU was not material to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Net Sales
The Company recognizes sales revenue, net of sales taxes and estimated sales returns, at the time it sells merchandise to the customer. eCommerce sales include shipping revenue and are recorded upon
delivery to the customer. Additionally, estimated sales returns are calculated based on expected returns.
Membership Fee Revenue
The Company recognizes membership fee revenue both in the U.S. and internationally over the term of the membership, which is typically 12 months. Membership fee revenue was $1.4 billion for each
of fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Membership fee revenue is included in membership and other income in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income. Deferred membership fee is
included in accrued liabilities in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Gift Cards
Customer purchases of gift cards are not recognized as sales until the card is redeemed and the customer purchases merchandise using the gift card. Gift cards in the U.S. and some countries do not carry
an expiration date; therefore, customers and members can redeem their gift cards for merchandise and services indefinitely. Gift cards in some countries where the Company does business have
expiration dates. While gift cards are generally redeemed within 12 months, a certain number of gift cards, both with and without expiration dates, will not be fully redeemed. Management estimates
unredeemed balances and recognizes revenue for these amounts in membership and other income in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income over the expected redemption period.
Management periodically reviews and updates its estimates.
Financial and Other Services
The Company recognizes revenue from service transactions at the time the service is performed. Generally, revenue from services is classified as a component of net sales in the Company's Condensed
Consolidated Statements of Income.
Contract Balances
Contract balances as a result of transactions with customers primarily consist of receivables included in receivables, net, and deferred gift card revenue included in accrued liabilities in the Company's
Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The following table provides the Company's receivables and deferred gift card revenue from transactions with customers:

Cost of Sales
Cost of sales includes actual product cost, the cost of transportation to the Company's distribution facilities, stores and clubs from suppliers, the cost of transportation from the Company's distribution
facilities to the stores, clubs and customers and the cost of warehousing for the Sam's Club segment and import distribution centers. Cost of sales is reduced by supplier payments that are not a
reimbursement of specific, incremental and identifiable costs.
Payments from Suppliers
The Company receives consideration from suppliers for various programs, primarily volume incentives, warehouse allowances and reimbursements for specific programs such as markdowns, margin
protection, advertising and supplier-specific fixtures. Payments from suppliers are accounted for as a reduction of cost of sales, except in certain limited situations when the payment is a reimbursement
of specific, incremental and identifiable costs, and are recognized in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income when the related inventory is sold.
Operating, Selling, General and Administrative Expenses
Operating, selling, general and administrative expenses include all operating costs of the Company, except cost of sales, as described above. As a result, the majority of the cost of warehousing and
occupancy for the Walmart U.S. and Walmart International segments' distribution facilities is included in operating, selling, general and administrative expenses. Because the Company only includes a
portion of the cost of its Walmart U.S. and Walmart International segments' distribution facilities in cost of sales, its gross profit and gross profit as a percentage of net sales may not be comparable to
those of other retailers that may include all costs related to their distribution facilities in cost of sales and in the calculation of gross profit.
Advertising Costs
Advertising costs are expensed as incurred, consist primarily of print, television and digital advertisements and are recorded in operating, selling, general and administrative expenses in the Company's
Consolidated Statements of Income. In certain limited situations, reimbursements from suppliers that are for specific, incremental and identifiable advertising costs are recognized as a reduction of
advertising costs in operating, selling, general and administrative expenses. Advertising costs were $3.5 billion , $3.1 billion and $2.9 billion for fiscal 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , respectively.
Currency Translation
The assets and liabilities of all international subsidiaries are translated from the respective local currency to the U.S. dollar using exchange rates at the balance sheet date. Related translation adjustments
are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss. The Company's Consolidated Statements of Income of all international subsidiaries are translated from the respective local
currencies to the U.S. dollar using average exchange rates for the period covered by the income statements.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
Leases
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) , which requires lease assets and liabilities to be recorded on the balance sheet. Certain qualitative and quantitative disclosures are
also required. The Company will adopt this ASU and related amendments as of the beginning of the first quarter of the year ending January 31, 2020 ("fiscal 2020") and will be electing certain practical
expedients permitted under the transition guidance, including to retain the historical lease classification as well as relief from reviewing expired or existing contracts to determine if they contain leases.
The Company will be exempting leases with an initial term of twelve months or less from balance sheet recognition and, for most classes of assets, the Company will be combining non-lease
components with lease components. Management has implemented and continues to implement new lease systems in connection with the adoption.
The adoption of this ASU and related amendments will result in total assets and liabilities increasing approximately $15 billion , which is primarily due to recognizing approximately $17.5 billion of
operating lease assets and liabilities, partially offset by derecognizing approximately $3 billion of assets and liabilities related to financial obligations connected with the construction of leased stores.
Several other line items in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet will also be impacted by immaterial amounts. The Company’s Consolidated Statements of Income and Consolidated Statements of
Cash Flows will not be materially impacted. Finally, management expects the first quarter fiscal 2020 disclosure of future operating commitments to significantly increase compared to the aggregate
minimum rentals disclosed in Note 11 , primarily because the new standard requires reasonably assured renewals be included.
59

Financial Instruments
In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments–Credit Losses (Topic 326) , which modifies the measurement of expected credit losses of certain financial instruments. The
Company will adopt this ASU on February 1, 2020. Management is currently evaluating this ASU to determine its impact to the Company's consolidated financial statements.

Note 2. Net Income Per Common Share
Basic net income per common share attributable to Walmart is based on the weighted-average common shares outstanding during the relevant period. Diluted net income per common share attributable
to Walmart is based on the weighted-average common shares outstanding during the relevant period adjusted for the dilutive effect of share-based awards. The Company did not have significant sharebased awards outstanding that were antidilutive and not included in the calculation of diluted net income per common share attributable to Walmart for fiscal 2019 , 2018 and 2017 .
The following table provides a reconciliation of the numerators and denominators used to determine basic and diluted net income per common share attributable to Walmart:

Share-Based Compensation
The Company has awarded share-based compensation to associates and nonemployee directors of the Company. The compensation expense recognized for all stock incentive plans, including expense
associated with plans of the Company's consolidated subsidiaries granted in the subsidiaries' respective stock, was $773 million , $626 million and $596 million for fiscal 2019 , 2018 and 2017 ,
respectively. Share-based compensation expense is generally included in operating, selling, general and administrative expenses in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income. The total income
tax benefit recognized for share-based compensation was $181 million , $150 million and $212 million for fiscal 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , respectively. The following table summarizes the Company's

The Walmart Inc. Stock Incentive Plan of 2015 (the "Plan"), as amended and restated effective February 23, 2016, as amended further as of February 1, 2017, and as renamed on February 1, 2018, was
established to grant stock options, restricted (non-vested) stock, performance share units and other equity compensation awards for which 260 million shares of Walmart common stock issued or to be
issued under the Plan have been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The Company believes that such awards serve to align the interests of its associates with those of its
shareholders.
61

The Plan's award types are summarized as follows:
• Restricted Stock and Performance Share Units. Restricted stock awards are for shares that vest based on the passage of time and include restrictions related to employment. Performance share
units vest based on the passage of time and achievement of performance criteria and may range from 0% to 150% of the original award amount. Vesting periods for these awards are generally
between one and three years. Restricted stock and performance share units may be settled or deferred in stock and are accounted for as equity in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. The
fair value of restricted stock awards is determined on the date of grant and is expensed ratably over the vesting period. The fair value of performance share units is determined on the date of grant
using the Company's stock price discounted for the expected dividend yield through the vesting period and is recognized over the vesting period. The weighted-average discount for the dividend
yield used to determine the fair value of performance share units in fiscal 2019 , 2018 and 2017 was 6.2% , 7.2% and 8.3% , respectively.
• Restricted Stock Units. Restricted stock units provide rights to Company stock after a specified service period; generally 50% vest three years from the grant date and the remaining 50% vest five
years from the grant date. The fair value of each restricted stock unit is determined on the date of grant using the stock price discounted for the expected dividend yield through the vesting period
and is recognized ratably over the vesting period. The expected dividend yield is based on the anticipated dividends over the vesting period. The weighted-average discount for the dividend yield
used to determine the fair value of restricted stock units granted in fiscal 2019 , 2018 and 2017 was 7.2% , 9.0% and 9.0% , respectively.
In addition to the Plan, the Company's United Kingdom subsidiary has stock option plans for certain colleagues which generally vest over three years. The stock option share-based compensation
expense is included in the Other line in the table above.
Flipkart also maintains a stock option plan primarily for the benefit of employees and nonemployee directors under which options to acquire Flipkart common shares may be issued. The grants have no
exercise price and no compensation expense was recognized during fiscal 2019 due to a liquidity event performance condition that was not deemed probable of occurrence.

Share Repurchase Program
From time to time, the Company repurchases shares of its common stock under share repurchase programs authorized by the Company's Board of Directors. All repurchases made during fiscal year 2019
were made under the current $20.0 billion share repurchase program approved in October 2017, which has no expiration date or other restrictions limiting the period over which the Company can make
share repurchases. As of January 31, 2019 , authorization for $11.3 billion of share repurchases remained under the share repurchase program. Any repurchased shares are constructively retired and
returned to an unissued status.
62

The Company regularly reviews share repurchase activity and considers several factors in determining when to execute share repurchases, including, among other things, current cash needs, capacity for
leverage, cost of borrowings, results of operations and the market price of the Company's common stock. The following table provides, on a settlement date basis, the number of shares repurchased,

In May 2018, the Company renewed and extended its existing five-year credit facility and its existing 364-day revolving credit facility, both of which are used to support its commercial paper program.

The committed lines of credit in the table above mature at various times between May 2019 and May 2023 , carry interest rates generally ranging between LIBOR plus 10 basis points and LIBOR plus
75 basis points, and incur commitment fees ranging between 1.5 and 4.0 basis points. In conjunction with the committed lines of credit listed in the table above, the Company has agreed to observe
certain covenants, the most restrictive of which relates to the maximum amount of secured debt. Additionally, the Company also maintains other committed lines of credit outside of the U.S., with
available amounts of approximately $3.0 billion and $4.0 billion as of January 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively, of which approximately $0.2 billion and no amount was drawn as of January 31, 2019
and 2018 , respectively.
Apart from the committed lines of credit, the Company has syndicated and fronted letters of credit available totaling $1.8 billion as of January 31, 2019 and 2018 , of which $1.6 billion and $1.5 billion
was drawn as of January 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. The Company also has trade letters of credit, without stated limits, of which $0.4 billion was drawn as of January 31, 2019 and 2018 .
The Company's long-term debt, which includes the fair value instruments further discussed in Note 8 , consists of the following as of January 31, 2019 and 2018 :

The average rate represents the weighted-average stated rate for each corresponding debt category, based on year-end balances and year-end interest rates. Interest costs are also impacted by certain derivatives described in Note 8 .
Includes deferred loan costs, discounts, fair value hedges, foreign-held debt and secured debt. As of January 31, 2019 and 2018 the Company had secured debt in the amount of $8 million and $10 million , respectively, which was
collateralized by property that had an aggregate carrying amount of $82 million and $101 million , respectively.

As of January 31, 2018 , the Company had $500 million in debt with embedded put options. These bonds matured in June 2018, and were fully repaid. The issuance of money market puttable reset
securities in the amount of $500 million is structured to be remarketed in connection with the annual reset of the interest rate. If, for any reason, the remarketing of the notes does not occur at the time of
any interest rate reset, the holders of the notes must sell and the Company must repurchase the notes at par.
65

Accordingly as of January 31, 2018 , this issuance was classified as long-term debt due within one year in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Note 7. Fair Value Measurements
Assets and liabilities recorded at fair value are measured using the fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value. The levels of the fair value hierarchy are:
• Level 1: observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets;
• Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable; and
• Level 3: unobservable inputs for which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring the Company to develop its own assumptions.
The Company measures the fair value of equity investments (primarily its investment in JD) on a recurring basis and records them in other long-term assets in the accompanying Consolidated Balance
Sheets. Measurement details about the Company's two portions of the investment in JD are as follows:
•

The purchased portion of the investment in JD measured using Level 1 inputs, which prior to fiscal 2019 was classified as available-for-sale with changes in fair value recognized through other
comprehensive income; and

•

The portion of the investment in JD received in exchange for selling certain assets related to Yihaodian, the Company's former eCommerce operation in China, measured using Level 2 inputs.
Fair value is determined primarily using quoted prices in active markets for similar assets. Prior to fiscal 2019, the investment was carried at cost.

Information for the cost basis, carrying value and fair value of the Company's investment in JD is as follows:

(2) Upon adoption of the new financial instrument standard on February 1, 2018, the excess of fair value over cost was recognized by increasing the carrying value of the asset and retained earnings.
(3) The decreases in fair value from February 1, 2018 to January 31, 2019 of $ 3.5 billion was recognized in net income and included in other gains and losses in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income.

The Company also has derivatives. Derivative fair values are the estimated amounts the Company would receive or pay upon termination of the related derivative agreements as of the reporting dates.
The fair values have been measured using the income approach and Level 2 inputs, which include the relevant interest rate and foreign currency forward curves. As of January 31, 2019 and January 31,
2018 , the notional amounts and fair values of these derivatives were as follows:

Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements
In addition to assets and liabilities that are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis, the Company's assets and liabilities are also subject to nonrecurring fair value measurements. Generally, assets are
recorded at fair value on a nonrecurring basis as a result of impairment charges.
As discussed in Note 13 , the Company sold the majority stake in Walmart Brazil during fiscal 2019. The assets of the disposal group totaled $3.3 billion and were comprised of $1.0 billion in current
assets, $1.6 billion in property and equipment and property under capital lease and financing obligations, net, and $0.7 billion of other long-term assets. When measured as held for sale, these assets were
fully impaired as the carrying value of the disposal group exceeded the fair value, less costs to sell and contributed to a pre-tax net loss of $4.8 billion in the Walmart International segment, which was
recorded in other gains and losses in the Company's Consolidated Statement of Income. Other impairment charges to assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis during fiscal 2019 were
immaterial.
68

For the fiscal year ended January 31, 2018 , the Company recorded impairment charges related to assets measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis of approximately $1.4 billion primarily related to
the following:
•
•
•

in the Sam's Club segment as discussed in Note 14 , $0.6 billion for restructuring charges for closures of underperforming clubs; the impaired assets consisted primarily of buildings and related
store fixtures, and leased assets of its retail operations;
in the Walmart International segment as discussed in Note 14 , $0.2 billion for restructuring charges for the wind-down of the Brazil first-party eCommerce business; the impaired assets
consisted primarily of fixtures and equipment; and
immaterial discontinued real estate projects in the Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club segments and decisions to exit certain international properties in the Walmart International segment.

These impairment charges were classified in operating, selling, general and administrative expenses in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income. The fair value was determined based on
comparable market values of similar properties or on a rental income approach, using Level 2 inputs. Impairment charges not related to restructuring or decisions to exit properties for fiscal 2018 were
not material.
Other Fair Value Disclosures
The Company records cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term borrowings at cost. The carrying values of these instruments approximate their fair value due to their short-term
maturities.
The Company's long-term debt is also recorded at cost. The fair value is estimated using Level 2 inputs based on the Company's current incremental borrowing rate for similar types of borrowing
arrangements. The carrying value and fair value of the Company's long-term debt as of January 31, 2019 and 2018 , are as follows:

Note 8. Derivatives
In connection with various derivative agreements, including master netting arrangements, the Company held cash collateral from counterparties of $220 million and $279 million as of January 31, 2019
and January 31, 2018 , respectively. Furthermore, as part of the master netting arrangements with each of these counterparties, the Company is also required to post collateral with a counterparty if the
Company's net derivative liability position exceeds $150 million with such counterparties. The Company did not have any cash collateral posted with counterparties as of January 31, 2019 and
January 31, 2018 , respectively.
As of January 31, 2019 and January 31, 2018 , the Company had ¥180 billion of outstanding long-term debt designated as a hedge of its net investment in Japan, as well as outstanding long-term debt of
£1.7 billion as of January 31, 2019 and January 31, 2018 that was designated as a hedge of its net investment in the United Kingdom. These nonderivative net investment hedges will mature on dates
ranging from July 2020 to January 2039 .
The Company's derivatives, as well as its nonderivative debt instruments designated and qualifying as net investment hedges, were classified as follows as of January 31, 2019 and 2018 in the

In December 2017, the Tax Act was enacted and significantly changed U.S. income tax law. Beginning January 2018, the Tax Act reduced the U.S. statutory tax rate and created new taxes focused on
foreign-sourced earnings and related-party payments, including the creation of the base erosion anti-abuse tax and a new tax on global intangible low-taxed income ("GILTI"). In addition, the Company
was subject to a one-time transition tax in fiscal 2018 on accumulated foreign subsidiary earnings not previously subject to U.S. income tax.
The SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, Income Tax Accounting Implications of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ("SAB 118"), which allowed companies to record provisional amounts during
a measurement period not to extend beyond one year of the enactment date. Due to the timing of the enactment and the complexity involved in applying the provisions of the Tax Act, the Company
made reasonable estimates of the effects and recorded provisional amounts in its financial statements as of January 31, 2018, in accordance with SAB 118. The Company elected to apply the

measurement period provisions of this guidance to certain income tax effects of the Tax Act when it became effective. The provisional measurement period ended in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019.
While management believes the Company's accounting for Tax Reform is complete, it is based on prevailing regulations and currently available information, and any additional guidance issued by the
IRS could impact the aforementioned amounts in future periods. The net tax benefit recognized in fiscal 2018 related to the Tax Act was $207 million , and in fiscal 2019, the Company recorded $442
million of additional tax expense related to the Tax Act, included as a component of provision for income taxes .
One-time Transition Tax
The Tax Act required the Company to pay U.S. income taxes on accumulated foreign subsidiary earnings not previously subject to U.S. income tax at a rate of 15.5% to the extent of foreign cash and
certain other net current assets, as defined by the Tax Act, and 8.0% on the remaining earnings. In fiscal 2018, the Company recorded a provisional amount of $1.9 billion of additional income tax
expense for its one-time transitional tax liability. The Company finalized the calculations of the Transition Tax liability and increased the provisional amount by $413 million , with the increase included
as a component of provision for income taxes in fiscal 2019.
Deferred Tax Effects
The Tax Act reduced the U.S. statutory tax rate from 35.0% to 21.0% , beginning January 2018. Accordingly, the Company re-measured its deferred taxes as of January 31, 2018, to reflect the reduced
rate that will apply in future periods when these deferred taxes are settled or realized. In fiscal 2018, the Company recognized a deferred tax benefit of $2.1 billion to reflect the reduced U.S. tax rate and
other effects of the Tax Act. In fiscal 2018, the Company made no provisional adjustment with respect to the GILTI provision of the Tax Act. Upon finalizing the provisional accounting for the
remeasurement of U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities in fiscal 2019, the Company recorded an additional tax benefit of $75 million , which is included as a component of provision for income taxes.

Effective Income Tax Rate Reconciliation
In the past, the Company's effective income tax rate was typically lower than the U.S. statutory tax rate primarily because of benefits from lower–taxed global operations, including the use of global
funding structures and certain U.S. tax credits as further discussed in the "Cash and Cash Equivalents" section of Note 1 . However, beginning January 2018, the US statutory rate of 21.0% generally
falls below statutory rates in international jurisdictions. A reconciliation of the significant differences between the U.S. statutory tax rate and the effective income tax rate on pretax income from
continuing operations is as follows:

Unremitted Earnings
Prior to the Tax Act, the Company asserted that all unremitted earnings of its foreign subsidiaries were considered indefinitely reinvested. As a result of the Tax Act, the Company reported and paid
U.S. tax on the majority of its previously unremitted foreign earnings. During fiscal 2019, the Company repatriated to the U.S. $5.3 billion of cash relating to fiscal 2019 and prior earnings at a tax cost
of approximately $40 million . As of January 31, 2019, the Company has not recorded approximately $ 3 billion of deferred tax liabilities associated with remaining unremitted foreign earnings
considered indefinitely reinvested, for which U.S. and foreign income and withholding taxes would be due upon repatriation.
Net Operating Losses, Tax Credit Carryforwards and Valuation Allowances
As of January 31, 2019 , the Company had net operating loss and capital loss carryforwards totaling $12.2 billion . Of these carryforwards, $8.0 billion will expire, if not utilized, in various years through
2039 . The remaining carryforwards have no expiration. As of January 31, 2019 , the Company's transition tax calculation fully utilized all foreign tax credit carryforwards.
The recoverability of these future tax deductions and credits is evaluated by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, including taxable income in prior carryback years,
reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies. To the extent the Company does not consider it more likely than not that a deferred tax asset
will be recovered, a valuation allowance is established. To the extent that a valuation allowance has been established and it is subsequently determined that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax
assets will be recovered, the valuation allowance will be released.
The Company had valuation allowances of $2.4 billion and $1.8 billion as of January 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively, on deferred tax assets associated primarily with net operating loss carryforwards
for which management has determined it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Net activity in the valuation allowance during fiscal 2019 related to the acquisition of
Flipkart and disposal of Walmart Brazil, changes in judgment regarding the future realization of deferred tax assets, releases arising from the use of deferred tax assets and decreases due to operating loss
expirations and fluctuations in currency exchange rates. Management believes that it is more likely than not that the remaining deferred tax assets will be fully realized.
Uncertain Tax Positions
The benefits of uncertain tax positions are recorded in the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements only after determining a more-likely-than-not probability that the uncertain tax positions will
withstand challenge, if any, from taxing authorities.
As of January 31, 2019 and 2018 , the amount of unrecognized tax benefits related to continuing operations was $1.3 billion and $1.0 billion , respectively. The amount of unrecognized tax benefits that
would affect the Company's effective income tax rate was $1.1 billion and $690 million as of January 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively.
A reconciliation of unrecognized tax benefits from continuing operations is as follows:

Interest expense and penalties related to these positions were immaterial for fiscal 2019 , 2018 and 2017 . During the next twelve months, it is reasonably possible that tax audit resolutions could reduce
unrecognized tax benefits by an immaterial amount, either because the tax positions are sustained on audit or because the Company agrees to their disallowance. The Company is focused on resolving
tax audits as expeditiously as possible. As a result of these efforts, unrecognized tax benefits could potentially be reduced beyond the provided range during the next twelve months. The Company does
not expect any change to have a material impact to its Consolidated Financial Statements.
The Company remains subject to income tax examinations for its U.S. federal income taxes generally for fiscal 2014 through 2019 . The Company also remains subject to income tax examinations for
international income taxes for fiscal 2012 through 2019 , and for U.S. state and local income taxes generally for the fiscal years ended 2013 through 2019 .
71

Other Taxes
The Company is subject to tax examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll and other non-income taxes. A number of these examinations are ongoing in various jurisdictions. In certain cases, the
Company has received assessments from the respective taxing authorities in connection with these examinations. Unless otherwise indicated, the possible losses or range of possible losses associated
with these matters are individually immaterial, but a group of related matters, if decided adversely to the Company, could result in a liability material to the Company's Consolidated Financial
Statements.
Note 10. Contingencies
Legal Proceedings
The Company is involved in a number of legal proceedings. The Company has made accruals with respect to these matters, where appropriate, which are reflected in the Company's Consolidated
Financial Statements. For some matters, a liability is not probable or the amount cannot be reasonably estimated and therefore an accrual has not been made. However, where a liability is reasonably
possible and may be material, such matters have been disclosed. The Company may enter into discussions regarding settlement of these matters, and may enter into settlement agreements, if it believes
settlement is in the best interest of the Company and its shareholders.
Unless stated otherwise, the matters discussed below, if decided adversely to or settled by the Company, individually or in the aggregate, may result in a liability material to the Company's financial
condition or results of operations.
ASDA Equal Value Claims
ASDA Stores, Ltd. ("Asda"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, is a defendant in nearly 30,000 "equal value" claims that are proceeding before an Employment Tribunal in Manchester (the
"Employment Tribunal") in the United Kingdom ("UK") on behalf of current and former Asda store employees, and further claims may be asserted in the future. The claimants allege that the work
performed by female employees in Asda's retail stores is of equal value in terms of, among other things, the demands of their jobs compared to that of male employees working in Asda's warehouse and
distribution facilities, and that the disparity in pay between these different job positions is not objectively justified. As a result, claimants are requesting differential back pay based on higher wage rates
in the warehouse and distribution facilities and higher wage rates on a prospective basis.
On March 23, 2015, Asda asked the Employment Tribunal to stay all proceedings and to "strike out" substantially all of the claims because the claimants had not adhered to the Tribunal's procedural rule
for including multiple claimants on the same claim form. On July 23, 2015, the Employment Tribunal denied Asda's requests. Following additional proceedings, on June 20, 2017, the Employment
Appeal Tribunal ruled in favor of Asda on the "strike out" issue and remitted the matter to the Employment Tribunal to determine whether the improperly filed claims should be struck out. On July 12,
2017, claimants sought permission from the Court of Appeals to appeal this ruling, which was granted on October 3, 2017. A hearing before the Court of Appeals on the "strike out" issue was held on
October 23, 2018. On January 17, 2019, the Court of Appeals declined to strike out any claims relying on the Employment Tribunal’s finding that claimants had not deliberately disregarded the
Tribunal’s procedural rule.
As to the initial phase of the Equal Value claims, on October 14, 2016, following a preliminary hearing, the Employment Tribunal ruled that claimants could compare their positions in Asda's retail
stores with those of employees in Asda's warehouse and distribution facilities. On August 31, 2017, the Employment Appeal Tribunal affirmed the Employment Tribunal's ruling and also granted
permission for Asda to appeal substantially all of its findings. Asda sought permission to appeal the remainder of the Employment Appeal Tribunal's findings to the Court of Appeals. A hearing before
the Court of Appeals on the comparability findings was held on October 10, 2018 and the Court of Appeals upheld the Employment Tribunal’s findings.
Claimants are now proceeding in the next phase of their claims. That phase will determine whether the work performed by the claimants is of equal value to the work performed by employees in Asda's
warehouse and distribution facilities.
At present, the Company cannot predict the number of such claims that may be filed, and cannot reasonably estimate any loss or range of loss that may arise from these proceedings. The Company
believes it has substantial factual and legal defenses to these claims, and intends to defend the claims vigorously.

National Prescription Opiate Litigation and Related Matters
In December 2017, the United States Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation consolidated numerous lawsuits filed against a wide array of defendants by various plaintiffs, including counties, cities,
healthcare providers, Native American tribes, individuals, and third-party payors, asserting claims generally concerning the impacts of widespread opioid abuse. The consolidated multidistrict litigation
is entitled In re National Prescription Opiate Litigation (MDL No. 2804) , and is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio. The Company is named as a defendant in some of
the cases included in this multidistrict litigation. Similar cases that name the Company have also been filed in state courts by state, local and tribal governments, health care providers and other plaintiffs.
Plaintiffs are seeking compensatory and punitive damages, as well as injunctive relief including abatement. The Company cannot predict the number of such claims that may be filed, but believes it has
substantial factual and legal defenses to these claims, and intends to defend the claims vigorously. The Company has also been responding to subpoenas, information requests and investigations from
governmental entities related to nationwide controlled substance dispensing and distribution practices involving opioids. The Company cannot reasonably estimate any loss or range of loss that may arise
from these matters. Accordingly, the Company can provide no assurance as to the scope and outcome of these matters and no assurance as to whether its business, financial position, results of operations
or cash flows will not be materially adversely affected.
FCPA Investigation and Related Matters
The Audit Committee (the "Audit Committee") of the Board of Directors of the Company has been conducting an internal investigation into, among other things, alleged violations of the U.S. Foreign
Corrupt Practices Act ("FCPA") and other alleged crimes or misconduct in connection with foreign subsidiaries, including Wal-Mart de México, S.A.B. de C.V. ("Walmex"), and whether prior
allegations of such violations and/or misconduct were appropriately handled by the Company. The Audit Committee and the Company have engaged outside counsel from a number of law firms and
other advisors who are assisting in the on-going investigation of these matters.
The Company has also been conducting a voluntary global review of its policies, practices and internal controls for anti-corruption compliance. The Company is engaged in strengthening its global anticorruption compliance program through appropriate remedial anti-corruption measures. In November 2011, the Company voluntarily disclosed that investigative activity to the U.S. Department of
Justice (the "DOJ") and the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"). Since the implementation of the global review and the enhanced anti-corruption compliance program, the Audit
Committee and the Company have identified or been made aware of additional allegations regarding potential violations of the FCPA. When such allegations have been reported or identified, the Audit
Committee and the Company, together with their third party advisors, have conducted inquiries and when warranted based on those inquiries, opened investigations. Inquiries or investigations regarding
allegations of potential FCPA violations were commenced in a number of foreign markets where the Company operates or has operated, including, but not limited to, Brazil, China and India.
As previously disclosed, the Company is under investigation by the DOJ and the SEC regarding possible violations of the FCPA. The Company has been cooperating with the agencies and discussions
have been ongoing regarding the resolution of these matters. These discussions have progressed to a point that, in fiscal 2018, the Company reasonably estimated a probable loss and recorded an
aggregate accrual of $283 million with respect to these matters (the "Accrual"). As the discussions are continuing, there can be no assurance as to the timing or the terms of the final resolution of these
matters.
A number of federal and local government agencies in Mexico also investigated these matters. Walmex cooperated with the Mexican governmental agencies that conducted these investigations.
Furthermore, lawsuits relating to the matters under investigation were filed by several of the Company's shareholders against Walmart, certain current and former directors and former officers and
certain of Walmex's former officers. These matters have been resolved or immaterial accruals have been made for proposed settlements.
The Company could be exposed to a variety of negative consequences as a result of the matters noted above. There could be one or more enforcement actions in respect of the matters that are the subject
of some or all of the on-going government investigations, and such actions, if brought, may result in judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions, cease and desist orders, debarment or other
relief, criminal convictions and/or penalties and shareholder lawsuits may result in judgments against the Company and its current and former directors and officers named in those proceedings. The
Company expects that there will be on-going media and governmental interest, including additional news articles from media publications on these matters, which could impact the perception among
certain audiences of the Company's role as a corporate citizen.
73

In addition, the Company has incurred and expects to continue to incur costs in responding to requests for information or subpoenas seeking documents, testimony and other information in connection
with the government investigations, in defending the shareholder lawsuits, and in conducting the review and investigations. These costs will be expensed as incurred. For the fiscal years ended
January 31, 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , the Company incurred the following third-party expenses in connection with the FCPA investigation and related matters:

The Company does not presently believe that these matters, including the Accrual (and the payment of the Accrual at some point-in-time in the future), will have a material adverse effect on its business,
financial position, results of operations or cash flows, although given the inherent uncertainties in such situations, the Company can provide no assurance that these matters will not be material to its
business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows in the future.
Note 11. Commitments
Rentals (including amounts applicable to taxes, insurance, maintenance, other operating expenses and contingent rentals) under operating leases and other short-term rental arrangements were $3.0

of the Company's store leases have renewal options, some of which may trigger an escalation in rentals.
Note 12. Retirement-Related Benefits
The Company offers a 401(k) plan for associates in the U.S. under which eligible associates can begin contributing to the plan immediately upon hire. The Company also offers a 401(k) type plan for
associates in Puerto Rico under which associates can begin to contribute generally after one year of employment. Under these plans, after one year of employment, the Company matches 100% of
participant contributions up to 6% of annual eligible earnings. The matching contributions immediately vest at 100% for each associate. Participants can contribute up to 50% of their pretax earnings, but
not more than the statutory limits.
Associates in international countries who are not U.S. citizens are covered by various defined contribution post-employment benefit arrangements. These plans are administered based upon the
legislative and tax requirements in the countries in which they are established.

Additionally, the Company's subsidiaries in the United Kingdom and Japan have sponsored defined benefit pension plans. The plan in the United Kingdom was overfunded by $326 million and $97
million as of January 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. The plan in Japan was underfunded by $175 million and $184 million as of January 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. Overfunded amounts are
recorded as assets in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets in other assets and deferred charges. Underfunded amounts are recorded as liabilities in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets in
deferred income taxes and other. Certain other international operations also have defined benefit arrangements that are not significant.
Note 13. Acquisitions, Disposals and Related Items
The following significant transactions impact, or are expected to impact, the operations of the Company's Walmart International segment. Other immaterial transactions have also occurred or been
announced.
Walmart Brazil
In August 2018, the Company sold an 80 percent stake of Walmart Brazil to Advent International ("Advent"). Under the terms, Advent agreed to contribute additional capital to the business over a threeyear period and Walmart agreed to indemnify Advent for certain matters. Additionally, the Company may receive up to approximately $250 million in contingent consideration. The disposal group
consisted of the following:
•
•
•

Assets of $3.3 billion , which were fully impaired as discussed in Note 7 upon meeting the held for sale criteria;
Liabilities of $1.3 billion , consisting of $0.7 billion in accounts payable and accrued liabilities, $0.1 billion of capital lease and financing obligations, and $0.5 billion of deferred taxes and
other long-term liabilities; and
Cumulative foreign currency translation loss of $2.0 billion , which was reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss (see Note 4 ).

As a result, the Company recorded a pre-tax net loss of $4.8 billion during during fiscal 2019 in other gains and losses in the Company's Consolidated Statement of Income . In calculating the loss, the
fair value of the disposal group was reduced by $0.8 billion related to an indemnity, for which a liability was recognized upon closing and is recorded in deferred income taxes and other in the
Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. Under the indemnity, the Company will indemnify Advent for certain pre-closing tax and legal contingencies and other matters for up to R$2.3 billion , adjusted
for interest based on the Brazilian interbank deposit rate.
The Company deconsolidated the financial statements of Walmart Brazil during the third quarter of fiscal 2019 and began accounting for its remaining 20 percent ownership interest, determined to have
no initial fair value, using the equity method of accounting.
Flipkart
In August 2018, the Company acquired 81 percent of the outstanding shares, or 77 percent of the diluted shares, of Flipkart, an Indian-based eCommerce marketplace , for cash consideration of
approximately $16 billion . The acquisition increases the Company's investment in India, a large, growing economy. The purchase price allocation, which is still preliminary primarily due to certain tax
items, is as follows:
•

Assets of $24.1 billion , which comprise primarily of $2.2 billion in cash and cash equivalents, $2.8 billion in other current assets, $5.0 billion in intangible assets and $13.6 billion in goodwill.
Of the intangible assets, $4.7 billion represents the fair value of trade names, each with an indefinite life, which were estimated using the income approach based on Level 3 unobservable
inputs. The remaining $0.3 billion of intangible assets primarily relate to acquired technology with a life of 3 years . The goodwill arising from the acquisition consists largely of anticipated
synergies and economies of scale primarily related to procurement and logistics and is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes;

•

Liabilities of $3.7 billion , which comprise primarily of $1.8 billion of current liabilities and $1.8 billion of deferred income taxes; and

•

Noncontrolling interest of $4.3 billion , for which the fair value was estimated using the income approach based on Level 3 unobservable inputs.
75

The Company began consolidating the financial statements of Flipkart in the third quarter of fiscal 2019, using a one-month lag . To finance the acquisition, the Company used a combination of cash
provided by long-term debt as discussed in Note 6 and cash on hand. The Flipkart results of operations since acquisition and the pro forma financial information are immaterial.
Asda
In April 2018, the Company entered into a definitive agreement and announced the proposed combination of J Sainsbury plc and Asda Group Limited ("Asda Group"), the Company's wholly owned UK
retail subsidiary. Under the terms of the combination, the Company would receive approximately 42 percent of the share capital of the combined company. In addition, the Company would receive
approximately £3 billion in cash, subject to customary closing adjustments, and retain obligations under the Asda Group defined benefit pension plan . Due to a complex regulatory review process, the
outcome of which continues to be uncertain, the held for sale classification criteria for the disposal group was not met as of January 31, 2019 . If the transaction closes, the Company would deconsolidate
the financial statements of Asda Group and account for the ongoing investment in the combined company using the equity method of accounting.
Suburbia
In April 2017, the Company sold Suburbia, the apparel retail division in Mexico, for $1.0 billion . As part of the sales agreement, the Company is also leasing certain real estate to the purchaser. The sale
resulted in a pre-tax gain of $0.7 billion , of which $0.4 billion was recognized in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 in membership and other income, and the remainder was deferred and is being
recognized over the lease terms of approximately 20 years .
Yihaodian and JD
In June 2016, the Company sold certain assets relating to Yihaodian, its eCommerce operations in China, including the Yihaodian brand, website and application, to JD in exchange for Class A ordinary
shares of JD, valued at $1.5 billion , representing approximately five percent of JD's outstanding ordinary shares on a fully diluted basis. The sale resulted in the recognition of a $535 million noncash
gain, which was included in membership and other income in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income. Subsequently, during fiscal 2017, the Company purchased $1.9 billion of additional
JD shares, representing an incremental ownership percentage of approximately five percent , for a total ownership of approximately ten percent of JD's outstanding ordinary shares.
The following significant transaction primarily impacts the Company's Walmart U.S. segment. Other immaterial transactions have also occurred or been announced.
Jet.com, Inc.
In September 2016, the Company completed the acquisition of jet.com, a U.S.-based eCommerce company. The integration of jet.com into the Walmart U.S. segment is building upon the current
eCommerce foundation, allowing for synergies from talent, logistical operations and access to a broader customer base. The total purchase price for the acquisition was $2.4 billion , net of cash acquired.
The allocation of the purchase price includes $1.7 billion in goodwill and $0.6 billion in intangible assets. As part of the transaction, the Company is paying additional compensation of approximately
$0.8 billion over a five year period.
Note 14. Restructuring Charges
In fiscal 2018, the Company announced several organizational changes to position the business for more efficient growth going forward. As a result, the Company recorded $1.2 billion in pre-tax
restructuring charges in fiscal 2018 as follows:

The asset impairment charges primarily relate to the real estate of the Sam's Club closures and the wind-down of the Brazil first-party eCommerce business, which were written down to their estimated
fair value. Refer to Note 7 for information on the fair value measurement.
The pre-tax restructuring charges of $1.2 billion are classified in operating, selling, general and administrative expenses in the Company's Consolidated Statement of Income for fiscal 2018. As of
January 31, 2018, substantially all of the severance costs were recorded in accrued liabilities in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets and were subsequently paid during fiscal 2019.
Note 15. Segments and Disaggregated Revenue
Segments
The Company is engaged in the operation of retail, wholesale and other units, as well as eCommerce websites, located throughout the U.S., Africa, Argentina, Canada, Central America, Chile, China,
India, Japan, Mexico and the United Kingdom, as well as Brazil prior to the sale of the majority stake of Walmart Brazil discussed in Note 13 . The Company's operations are conducted in three
reportable segments: Walmart U.S., Walmart International and Sam's Club. The Company defines its segments as those operations whose results the chief operating decision maker ("CODM") regularly
reviews to analyze performance and allocate resources. The Company sells similar individual products and services in each of its segments. It is impractical to segregate and identify revenues for each of
these individual products and services.
The Walmart U.S. segment includes the Company's mass merchant concept in the U.S., as well as eCommerce and omni-channel initiatives. The Walmart International segment consists of the
Company's operations outside of the U.S., as well as eCommerce and omni-channel initiatives. The Sam's Club segment includes the warehouse membership clubs in the U.S., as well as samsclub.com
and omni-channel initiatives. Corporate and support consists of corporate overhead and other items not allocated to any of the Company's segments.
The Company measures the results of its segments using, among other measures, each segment's net sales and operating income, which includes certain corporate overhead allocations. From time to
time, the Company revises the measurement of each segment's operating income, including any corporate overhead allocations, as determined by the information regularly reviewed by its CODM. In
fiscal 2019, the Company revised certain of its corporate overhead allocations, including depreciation expense, to the operating segments and, accordingly, revised prior period amounts for comparability
. Information for the Company's segments, as well as for Corporate and support, including the reconciliation to income before income taxes, is provided in the following table:

ITEM 9A.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

General
Management is responsible for the preparation, integrity and objectivity of Walmart Inc.'s Consolidated Financial Statements and other financial information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10K. Those Consolidated Financial Statements were prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. In preparing those Consolidated Financial Statements,
management is required to make certain estimates and judgments, which are based upon currently available information and management's view of current conditions and circumstances.
The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors oversees our process of reporting financial information and the audit of our Consolidated Financial Statements. The Audit Committee stays informed of
the financial condition of Walmart Inc. and regularly reviews management's financial policies and procedures, the independence of our independent auditors, our internal control over financial reporting
and the objectivity of our financial reporting. Both the independent auditors and the internal auditors have free access to the Audit Committee and meet with the Audit Committee regularly, both with
and without management present.
Acting through our Audit Committee, we have retained Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, to audit our Consolidated Financial Statements appearing in this Annual
Report on Form 10-K. We have made available to Ernst & Young LLP all of our financial records and related data in connection with their audit of our Consolidated Financial Statements. We have filed
with the SEC the required certifications related to our Consolidated Financial Statements as of and for the year ended January 31, 2019 . These certifications are attached as exhibits to this Annual
Report on Form 10-K. Additionally, we have also provided to the New York Stock Exchange the required annual certification of our Chief Executive Officer regarding our compliance with the New
York Stock Exchange's corporate governance listing standards.
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information, which is required to be timely disclosed, is accumulated and communicated to
management in a timely fashion. In designing and evaluating such controls and procedures, we recognize that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only
reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. Our management is necessarily required to use judgment in evaluating controls and procedures. Also, we have investments in
unconsolidated entities. Since we do not control or manage those entities, our controls and procedures with respect to those entities are substantially more limited than those we maintain with respect to
our consolidated subsidiaries.
In the ordinary course of business, we review our internal control over financial reporting and make changes to our systems and processes to improve such controls and increase efficiency, while
ensuring that we maintain an effective internal control environment. Changes may include such activities as implementing new, more efficient systems, updating existing systems, automating manual
processes, standardizing controls globally, migrating certain processes to our shared services organizations and increasing monitoring controls. During fiscal 2019, we announced an agreement to
outsource select accounting transaction-processing activities which is part of an ongoing initiative to enhance our shared service model. These changes have not materially affected, and are not
reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting. However, they allow us to continue to enhance our internal control over financial reporting and ensure that
our internal control environment remains effective.
An evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report was performed under the supervision and with
the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that
our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure and are effective to provide reasonable assurance that such information is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the SEC's
rules and forms.

Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Management has responsibility for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Management has assessed the effectiveness of the Company's internal
control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2019 . In making its assessment, management has utilized the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations ("COSO") of the
Treadway Commission in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013). Management concluded that based on its assessment, Walmart's internal control over financial reporting was effective as of
January 31, 2019 . The Company's internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2019 , has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP as stated in their report which appears herein.
Under guidelines established by the SEC, companies are allowed to exclude acquisitions from their first assessment of internal control over financial reporting following the date of acquisition. Based on
those guidelines, management's assessment of the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting excluded Flipkart Private Limited ("Flipkart"), which the Company acquired in
fiscal 2019, except for the recognition of goodwill and intangible assets that were included in management's assessment. Flipkart represented approximately 2% of the Company’s total assets as of
January 31, 2019, after excluding goodwill and intangible assets recorded, and approximately 1% of the Company’s net sales for the year ended January 31, 2019. The Company's acquisition of Flipkart
is discussed in Note 13 to its Consolidated Financial Statements for fiscal 2019.
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
There has been no change in the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2019 , that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's
internal control over financial reporting.
Report on Ethical Standards
Our Company was founded on the belief that open communication and the highest ethical standards are necessary to be successful. Our long-standing "Open Door" communication policy helps
management be aware of and address issues in a timely and effective manner. Through the open door policy all associates are encouraged to inform management at the appropriate level when they are
concerned about any matter pertaining to Walmart.
Walmart has adopted a Statement of Ethics to guide our associates in the continued observance of high ethical standards such as honesty, integrity and compliance with the law in the conduct of
Walmart's business. Familiarity and compliance with the Statement of Ethics is required of all associates. The Company also maintains a separate Code of Ethics for our senior financial officers.
Walmart also has in place a Related-Party Transaction Policy. This policy applies to Walmart's senior officers and directors and requires material related-party transactions to be reviewed by the Audit
Committee. The senior officers and directors are required to report material related-party transactions to Walmart. We maintain a global ethics and compliance office which oversees and administers
several reporting mechanisms, including an ethics helpline. The ethics helpline provides a channel for associates to ask questions and make confidential complaints regarding potential violations of our
statements of ethics, including violations related to financial or accounting matters. These contacts may be made anonymously.

WALMART DEFERRED COMPENSATION MATCHING PLAN ARTICLE I. GENERAL 1.1 Purpose. The purpose of the Walmart Deferred Compensation Matching Plan is to enable certain individuals to defer compensation and to be credited with matching allocations and earnings. The Plan is intended to reward such individuals for their contributions to the success of Walmart and its Related Affiliates. The Plan is also intended to assist such individuals in saving for retirement by providing benefits that are in excess of benefits permitted by applicable law under the 401(k) Plan. 1.2 Effective Date. The effective date of the amended and restated Plan is February 1, 2019. 1.3 Nature of Plan. The Plan is intended to be (and shall be administered as) an unfunded employee pension plan benefiting a select group of management or highly compensated employees under the provisions of ERISA. The Plan shall be “unfunded” for tax purposes and for purposes of Title I of ERISA. Any and all payments under the Plan shall be made solely from the general assets of Walmart. A Participant’s interests under the Plan do not represent or create a claim against specific assets of Walmart or any Employer. Nothing herein shall be deemed to create a trust of any kind or create any fiduciary relationship between the Committee, Walmart or any Employer and a Participant, the Participant’s beneficiary or any other person. To the extent any person acquires a right to receive payments from Walmart under this Plan, such right is no greater than the right of any other unsecured general creditor of Walmart. The Plan is intended to be in compliance with Code Section 409A and shall be interpreted, applied and administered at all times in accordance with Code Section 409A and guidance issued thereunder. ARTICLE II. DEFINITIONS 2.1 Definitions.

(q) 401(k) Plan means the Walmart 401(k) Plan and the Walmart Puerto Rico 401(k) Plan, as amended from time to time. (r) Gross Misconduct means conduct engaged in by the Participant which has been deemed by the Committee or its delegate to be detrimental to the best interests of Walmart or any Related Affiliate or any entity in which Walmart has an ownership interest.

(w) Plan Year means the twelve (12)-month period commencing on February 1 and ending on January 31.

Regs. Sec. 1.414(c)-2 for purposes of determining a controlled group of trades or businesses under Code Section 414(c), the language “at least 50 percent” shall be used instead of “at least 80 percent” in each place it appears in Treas. Regs. Sec. 1.414(c)-2. (y) Retirement Account means a bookkeeping account maintained on behalf of a
Participant to which the Participant’s Deferral Account and Matching Account - 4 -

may be allocated pursuant to the election or deemed election of the Participant in accordance with Section 3.5. The number of Retirement Accounts a Participant may have under the Plan at any time shall be determined by the Committee or its delegate. (z) Scheduled In-Service Account means a bookkeeping account maintained on behalf of a Participant to which the Participant’s Deferral Account may be allocated pursuant to the election of the Participant in accordance with Section 3.5. The number of Scheduled In-Service Accounts a Participant may have under the Plan at any time shall be determined by the Committee or its delegate. (aa) Scheduled Pay Date means, with respect to each Scheduled In-Service Account, the first day of a calendar month designated by the Participant in accordance with Section 3.5. In no event shall such date be earlier than the first day of the second Plan Year beginning after the Plan Year for which Deferral Credits are first allocated to such Scheduled In-Service Account. Once selected, the Scheduled Pay Date with respect to any Scheduled In-Service Account is irrevocable. If a Participant fails to designate a Scheduled Pay Date with respect to a Scheduled In-Service Account, then the Participant is deemed to have designated as the Scheduled Pay Date for such Scheduled In-Service Account the first day of the second Plan Year beginning after the Plan Year for which Deferral Credits are first allocated to such Scheduled In-Service Account. (bb) Separation from Service means the Participant has a termination of employment (other than on account of death) with the Company. For purposes of this paragraph, “Company” means the Employer and any Related Affiliate.

For this purpose, a Participant is not treated as having a Separation from Service while he or she is on a military leave, sick leave, or
other bona fide leave of absence, if the period of such leave does not exceed six (6) months, or if longer, so long as the Participant has a right to reemployment with the Company under an applicable statute or by contract. This definition of Separation from Service is intended to be consistent with the separation from service requirements as defined in Code Section 409A. (cc) Separation Pay Date means the last day of the calendar month in which falls the date that is six (6) months after a Participant’s Separation from Service. - 5 -

(dd) Special Bonus means a bonus, other than a bonus payable under the MIP, that is payable to an Eligible Officer with respect to services rendered or to be rendered for an Employer and that is eligible for deferral under the Plan either because (1) the bonus is payable pursuant to an offer letter accepted in writing by the Eligible Officer before commencement of employment and that specifically refers to the deferability of the bonus by explicit reference to this Plan or (2) the bonus is eligible for deferral in accordance with guidelines established by the Committee, or by an officer to whom the Committee has delegated authority to establish such guidelines, and the bonus requires as a condition of receipt of the bonus and to avoid forfeiture of the bonus that the recipient continue to perform services for the Employer for a period of at least thirteen (13) months after the date he or she obtains the legally binding right to the bonus. (ee) Unforeseeable Emergency means a severe financial hardship to the Participant resulting from an illness or accident of the Participant, the Participant’s spouse, the Participant’s beneficiary, or the Participant’s dependent (as defined in Code Section 152, without regard to subsections (b)(1), (b)(2) and (d)(1)(B)), the loss of the Participant’s property due to casualty, or other similar extraordinary and unforeseeable circumstances arising as a result of events beyond the control of the Participant. (ff) Valuation Date means each day of the Plan Year. (gg) Walmart means Walmart Inc., a Delaware corporation. (hh) Years of Participation means a period of Plan Years which includes the first Plan Year with respect to which an Eligible Participant makes a deferral election in accordance with any one or more of Sections 3.1, 3.2 and 3.3 and an amount is credited to the Participant’s Account with respect to any such deferral election, and each subsequent Plan Year during all or part of which the Participant remains a Participant. In addition to the preceding definition, a Participant’s Years of Participation shall include any period commencing February 1 and ending January 31, whether before or after the effective date of the Plan, during which or with respect to which an account is maintained for the Participant under the Walmart Inc. Officer Deferred Compensation Plan, as such plan may be amended from time to time. ARTICLE III. DEFERRAL CREDITS AND MATCHING CONTRIBUTION CREDITS AND ACCOUNT ALLOCATIONS 3.1 Deferred Compensation. (a) For each Plan Year, each Eligible Officer may elect to defer, as Deferred Compensation, all or a portion of the Eligible Officer’s Compensation to be otherwise
paid for such Plan Year by the Employer, provided, however, that no election shall be effective to reduce amounts paid by the Employer to an - 6 -

Eligible Officer to an amount which is less than the sum of the amount the Employer is required to withhold for a Plan Year for purposes of federal, state, or local taxes (including, but not limited to, income and FICA withholding) or for insurance premiums or other withholdings as allowed by Code Section 409A . The Eligible Officer’s Deferred Compensation will be deferred proratably for each payroll period of the Plan Year. If a payroll period begins in one Plan Year and ends in the following Plan Year, the Deferred Compensation with respect to such payroll period shall be determined by the Eligible Officer’s deferral election made with respect to the Plan Year in which the payroll period ends. All deferral elections made under this Section 3.1 must be filed with Walmart’s Executive Compensation department on forms (which may be electronic) approved by Executive Compensation. (b) Compensation deferral elections must be filed: (1) With respect to an individual who is an Eligible Officer as of the December 31 preceding the Plan Year for which the deferral election is to be effective, no later than such December 31; or (2) With respect to an individual who first becomes an Eligible Officer during the Plan Year, within thirty (30) days following the first date he or she becomes an Eligible Officer. For purposes of this rule, an Eligible Officer will be treated as first becoming an Eligible Officer during the Plan Year only if: (A) he or she was not eligible to participate in the Plan or any other plan required by Code Section 409A to be aggregated with the Plan at any time during the twenty-four (24)-month period ending on the date during the Plan Year he or she becomes an Eligible Officer; or (B) he or she was paid all amounts previously due under the Plan and any other plan required by Code Section 409A to be aggregated with the Plan and, on and before the date of the last such payment, was not eligible to continue to participate in the Plan and any other plan required by Code Section 409A to be aggregated with the Plan for periods after such payment. A deferral election under this Section 3.1(b)(2) will be effective only with respect to Compensation for payroll periods beginning after the payroll period in which the Eligible Officer’s election form (which may be electronic) is received by Walmart’s Executive Compensation department. In addition, a deferral election under this Section 3.1(b)(2) will be effective only if the deferral election meets the requirements set forth in Code Section 409A(a)(4)(B). - 7 -

(c) The Deferred Compensation of an Eligible Officer who elects to defer all or a portion of the Eligible Officer’s Compensation under this Section 3.1 with respect to a Plan Year shall be credited to the Eligible Officer’s Deferral Account for such Plan Year and shall be allocated to a Retirement Account or to a Scheduled In-Service Account in accordance with Section 3.5. 3.2 Deferred MIP Bonuses. (a) For each Plan Year, each Eligible Participant may elect to defer all or a portion of the Eligible Participant’s bonus (if any) to be otherwise paid to the Eligible Participant under the MIP with respect to a performance period under the MIP that coincides with the Plan Year or that ends within the Plan Year; provided, however, an Eligible Participant who is not an Eligible Officer may elect to defer no more than eighty percent (80%) of the Eligible Participant’s MIP bonus for a Plan Year. No election under this Section 3.2 shall be effective to reduce amounts paid by the Employer to an Eligible Participant to an amount which is less than the sum of the amount the Employer is required to withhold for a Plan Year for purposes of federal, state, or local taxes (including, but not limited to, income and FICA withholding) or for insurance premiums or other withholdings as allowed by Code Section 409A. All bonus deferral elections made under this Section 3.2 must be filed with Walmart’s Executive Compensation department on forms (which may be electronic) approved by Executive Compensation. (b) MIP bonus deferral elections must be filed: (1) No later than the December 31 (or such other date as determined by the Committee or its delegate) preceding the first day of the performance period for which the deferral election is to be effective. (2) If authorized by the Committee or its delegate with respect to an Eligible Participant, and if the MIP bonus constitutes “performance-based compensation” within the meaning of Code Section 409A based on services performed over a performance period of at least twelve (12) months, and if the Eligible Participant has been continuously employed by an Employer or a Related Affiliate since the first day of the performance period, then no later than the earlier of (i) the date that is six months prior to the last day of the performance period, or (ii) the date in the performance period as of which the amount of the MIP bonus has become both substantially certain to be paid and calculable. (3) Solely with respect to an Eligible Officer who first becomes an Eligible Participant during the Plan Year, within thirty (30) days following the first date he or she becomes an Eligible Participant, as described in Code Section
409A(a)(4)(B). For purposes of this rule, an Eligible Officer will be treated as first becoming an Eligible Participant during the Plan Year only if: - 8 -

(A) he or she was not eligible to participate in the Plan or any other plan required by Code Section 409A to be aggregated with the Plan at any time during the twenty-four (24)-month period ending on the date during the Plan Year he or she becomes an Eligible Participant; or (B) he or she was paid all amounts previously due under the Plan and any other plan required by Code Section 409A to be aggregated with the Plan and, on and before the date of the last such payment, was not eligible to continue to participate in the Plan and any other plan required by Code Section 409A to be aggregated with the Plan for periods after such payment. An MIP bonus deferral election under this Section 3.2(b)(3) will be effective only with respect to an MIP bonus paid for services performed after such election. For this purpose, the amount of the MIP bonus payable to the Eligible Officer for services rendered subsequent to the Eligible Officer’s election will be determined by multiplying the bonus by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of calendar days remaining in the performance period after the election and the denominator of which is the total number of calendar days in such performance period. For purposes of this Section 3.2(b)(3), the date of an Eligible Officer’s election is the date the executed election form (which may be electronic) is received by Walmart’s Executive Compensation department. (c) The Deferred MIP Bonus of an Eligible Participant who elects to defer all or a portion of the Eligible Participant’s MIP bonus under this Section 3.2 with respect to a performance period that coincides with a Plan Year or that ends within a Plan Year shall be credited to the Eligible Participant’s Deferral Account for such Plan Year and shall be allocated to a Retirement Account or to a Scheduled In-Service Account in accordance with Section 3.5. 3.3 Deferred Special Bonuses. (a) An Eligible Officer may elect to defer all or a portion of the Eligible Officer’s Special Bonus to be otherwise paid to the Eligible Officer in a Plan Year. All Special Bonus deferral elections made under this Section 3.3 must be filed with Walmart’s Executive Compensation department on forms (which may be electronic) approved by Executive Compensation. No election under this Section 3.3 shall be effective to reduce amounts paid by the Employer to an Eligible Participant to an amount which is less than the sum of the amount the Employer is required to withhold for a Plan Year for purposes of federal, state, or local taxes (including, but not limited to, income and FICA withholding) for insurance premiums or other withholdings as allowed by Code Section
409A.For purposes of this Section 3.3, the date of an Eligible Officer’s election is the date the executed election form (which may be electronic) is received by - 9 -

Executive Compensation. A deferral election is not permitted with respect to a Special Bonus unless the Special Bonus is a type described in, and the deferral election with respect to the Special Bonus satisfies the applicable conditions of, Section 3.3(b) or Section 3.3(c). (b) A Special Bonus described in this Section 3.3(b) is one that: (1) requires as a condition of receipt of the Special Bonus and to avoid forfeiture of the Special Bonus that the Eligible Officer continue to perform services for a period of at least thirteen (13) months after the date he or she obtains the legally binding right to the Special Bonus; (2) may not have an earlier vesting date for a good reason termination or the Eligible Officer’s retirement; and (3) must otherwise meet the qualifications as described in Code Section 409A. The deferral election with respect to a Special Bonus described in this Section 3.3(b) must be filed within thirty (30) days after the Eligible Officer obtains the legally binding right to the Special Bonus. (c) A Special Bonus described in this Section 3.3(c) is one payable pursuant to an offer letter accepted in writing by an Eligible Officer before commencement of employment and that specifically refers to the deferability of the Special Bonus by explicit reference to the Plan. The deferral election with respect to a Special Bonus described in this Section 3.3(c) must be filed prior to the time the Eligible Officer renders any services to the Employer, regardless of whether the deferral election relates to all of the Special Bonus or a portion of the Special Bonus. (d) The Deferred Special Bonus of an Eligible Officer who elects to defer all or a portion of the Eligible Officer’s Special Bonus under this Section 3.3 otherwise payable in a Plan Year shall be credited to the Eligible Officer’s Deferral Account for such Plan Year and shall be allocated to a Retirement Account or to a Scheduled In-Service Account in accordance with Section 3.5. 3.4 Employer Matching Contribution Credits. (a) If a Participant is employed by the Employer or any Related Affiliate on the last day of the Plan Year and has not incurred a Separation from Service during that Plan Year and if Deferral Credits have been made to the Participant’s Account with respect to the Plan Year, then to the extent applicable under the following provisions of this Section 3.4 an Employer Matching Contribution Credit will be made to the Participant’s Matching Account. The amount of the Employer Matching Contribution Credit, if any, made to a Participant’s Matching Account for the Plan Year will equal the total amount of Deferred Compensation and Deferred MIP Bonus credited to the Participant’s
Account for the Plan Year under Section 3.1(c) and Section 3.2(c); provided, however, in no event shall the Employer Matching Contribution Credit made to a Participant’s Matching Account for a Plan Year exceed 6% of the Participant’s Excess Compensation for such Plan Year. Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this Section 3.4(a), an Employer Matching Contribution Credit for a Plan Year shall not be - 10 -

made with respect to any Deferral Credits for the Plan Year that have been withdrawn in accordance with Section 5.5. (b) A Participant shall become vested in his or her Matching Account, including earnings thereon, if the Participant has completed at least three (3) Years of Participation. If a Participant is not otherwise vested in the Participant’s Matching Account under the preceding sentence of this Section 3.4(b), the Participant will become vested in the Participant’s Matching Contribution Account if the Participant dies prior to the Participant’s Separation from Service, or if the Participant is Disabled. Notwithstanding any provision hereunder to the contrary, a Participant’s Matching Account shall be distributed pursuant to Article V only if the Participant has become vested in the Participant’s Matching Contribution Account under this Section 3.4(b) as of the date of the Participant’s Separation from Service. 3.5 Account Allocation Elections (a) At the same time that an Eligible Participant makes an election to defer Compensation, an MIP bonus, or a Special Bonus in accordance with the provisions of the Plan, the Eligible Participant shall also make an election to allocate the amount or amounts subject to each such deferral election to a Retirement Account or Accounts or to a Scheduled In-Service Account or Accounts. In addition to the preceding requirement, at the same time that an Eligible Participant makes an election to defer Compensation or an MIP bonus in accordance with the provisions of this Plan, the Eligible Participant shall also make an election to allocate the Employer Matching Contribution Credits (if any) with respect to such Deferred Compensation or Deferred MIP Bonus to a Retirement Account or Accounts. (b) At the time of an Eligible Participant’s first election to allocate any amount subject to a deferral election (regardless of whether the amount is Deferred Compensation, Deferred MIP Bonus, Deferred Special Bonus or Employer Matching Contribution Credit) to a Retirement Account, the Eligible Participant shall also designate the form of distribution with respect to such Retirement Account. The form of distribution must be a form permitted under Section 5.4(a). (c) At the time of an Eligible Participant’s first election to allocate any amount subject to a deferral election (regardless of whether the amount is Deferred Compensation, Deferred MIP Bonus or Deferred Special Bonus) to a Scheduled In-Service Account, the Eligible Participant shall also designate the Scheduled Pay Date with respect to such Scheduled In-Service Account. (d) If at the time of an Eligible Participant’s deferral election under the Plan the
Eligible Participant fails to make an account allocation election under Section 3.5(a), then the amount subject to such deferral election shall be allocated in the same manner as the same category of deferred amounts (meaning either - 11 -

Deferred Compensation, Deferred MIP Bonus, Deferred Special Bonus or Employer Matching Contribution Credits) were allocated for the most recent preceding Plan Year for which the Eligible Participant made an allocation election, but if none then to the Eligible Participant’s Retirement Account if there is only one, or equally to the Eligible Participant’s Retirement Accounts if the Eligible Participant has more than one Retirement Accounts, but if the Eligible Participant has no Retirement Account then the amount subject to such deferral election shall be allocated to a Retirement Account deemed to be elected by the Participant with a lump sum form of payment, and such Retirement Account shall be one of the Participant’s permitted Retirement Accounts under the Plan. 3.6 Irrevocability of Deferral Elections and Account Allocation Elections. (a) Except as otherwise provided herein, once made for a Plan Year, a deferral election or elections under Sections 3.1(b)(1), 3.2(b)(1) and 3.2(b)(2), and the corresponding account allocation election or elections under Section 3.5, may not be revoked, changed or modified after the applicable deferral election filing deadline specified in Sections 3.1(b)(1), 3.2(b)(1), and 3.2(b)(2), and a deferral election or elections under Sections 3.1(b)(2), 3.2(b)(3), 3.3(b) and 3.3(c), and the corresponding account allocation election or elections under Section 3.5, may not be revoked, changed or modified after the date of each such deferral election as provided in Sections 3.1(b)(2), 3.2(b)(3), 3.3(b) and 3.3(c). A deferral election for one Plan Year will not automatically be given effect for a subsequent Plan Year, so that if a deferral is desired for a subsequent Plan Year, a separate election must be made by the Eligible Participant. (b) In the event an Eligible Officer has a Separation from Service for any reason, then his or her deferral election under Section 3.1 will terminate as of the date of such Separation from Service (but will be effective with respect to the last regular paycheck issued to such Eligible Officer), regardless of whether the Eligible Officer continues to receive Compensation, or other remuneration, from any Employer or Related Affiliate thereafter. If an Eligible Officer has a Separation from Service for any reason and is rehired (whether or not as an Eligible Officer) within the same Plan Year, his or her deferral election, if any, under Section 3.1 shall be automatically reinstated and shall remain in effect for the remainder of such Plan Year. (c) In the event an Eligible Participant has a Separation from Service for any reason, then his or her deferral elections, if any, under Sections 3.2 and 3.3 will
remain in effect with respect to the bonus, if any, subject to any such deferral election. If an Eligible Participant has a Separation from Service for any reason and is rehired (whether or not as an Eligible Participant) within the same Plan Year or the same performance period, his or her deferral elections, if any, under Sections 3.2 and 3.3 will remain in effect with respect to the bonus, if any, subject to any such deferral elections. - 12 -

(d) In the event an Eligible Participant who is an Eligible Officer ceases to be an Eligible Officer (other than on account of a Separation from Service) during any Plan Year, then his or her Compensation deferral election, if any, under Section 3.1 will terminate as of the next following January 31. In addition, in the event the Compensation of such individual is reduced as a result of the change in status, his or her deferral election following such loss and through the date of termination of such election as provided in the preceding sentence will be pro rated based on his or her new level of Compensation. (e) In the event an Eligible Officer receives Company-paid short term disability payments and the Compensation of such individual is reduced as a result of the short term disability status, then following such reduction in Compensation his or her Compensation deferral election, if any, under Section 3.1 will be pro rated based on his or her new level of Compensation through the date of termination of such election. (f) In the event an Eligible Participant ceases to be an Eligible Participant (other than on account of a Separation from Service) during any Plan Year, then his or her bonus deferral election, if any, under Section 3.2 will terminate for any performance period beginning in the calendar year following the year of the loss of Eligible Participant status. (e) In the event an Eligible Participant who is an Eligible Officer ceases to be an Eligible Officer (other than on account of Separation from Service) during any Plan Year, then his or her bonus deferral election, if any, under Section 3.3 will remain in effect. (f) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in the event an Eligible Officer goes on an unpaid leave of absence, his or her Compensation deferral election, if any, under Section 3.1 shall automatically cease when he or she commences the unpaid leave of absence; provided, however, that if he or she returns from the unpaid leave of absence during the same Plan Year, his or her Compensation deferral election under Section 3.1 shall automatically resume immediately upon return from the leave of absence and shall continue in effect for the balance of the Plan Year. An Eligible Officer’s Compensation deferral election under Section 3.1, if any, shall remain in effect with respect to any Compensation to which such election applies that is paid while on a leave of absence. An Eligible Participant’s deferral election under Sections 3.2 or 3.3, if any, shall not be affected by his or her leave of absence. 3.7 Automatic Suspension of Deferral Elections. (a) In the event a Participant receives a distribution from the Walmart 401(k) Plan (or any other plan
or successor plan sponsored by Walmart or any Related Affiliate) on account of hardship, which distribution is made pursuant to Treasury Regulations Section 1.401(k)-1(d)(3) and requires suspension of deferrals under other arrangements such as this Plan, the Participant’s deferral - 13 -

elections under Sections 3.1, 3.2 and 3.3, if any, pursuant to which deferrals would otherwise be made during the six (6)-month period following the date of the distribution from the Walmart 401(k) Plan shall be cancelled. (b) In the event a Participant requests a distribution pursuant to Section 5.5 due to an Unforeseeable Emergency, or the Participant requests a cancellation of deferrals under the Plan in order to alleviate his or her Unforeseeable Emergency, and the Committee or its delegate determines that the Participant’s Unforeseeable Emergency may be relieved through the cessation of deferrals under the Plan, some or all the Participant’s deferral elections under Sections 3.1, 3.2 and 3.3, if any, for such Plan Year as determined by the Committee or its delegate, shall be cancelled as soon as administratively practicable following such determination by the Committee or its delegate. ARTICLE IV. ACCOUNTS AND TIMING OF CREDITS TO ACCOUNTS 4.1 Nature of Accounts. Each Participant’s Account will be used solely as a measuring device to determine the amount to be paid a Participant under this Plan. The Accounts do not constitute, nor will they be treated as, property or a trust fund of any kind. All amounts at any time attributable to a Participant’s Account will be, and remain, the sole property of Walmart. A Participant’s rights hereunder are limited to the right to receive Plan benefits as provided herein. The Plan represents an unsecured promise by Walmart to pay the benefits provided by the Plan. 4.2 Deferral Credits and Employer Matching Contribution Credits. Deferral Credits and Employer Matching Contribution Credits will be credited to each Participant’s Account as follows: (a) Deferred Compensation will be credited to the Participant’s Deferral Account as soon as practicable after the date such Compensation would have otherwise been paid in cash. (b) Deferred MIP Bonuses and Deferred Special Bonuses will be credited to the Participant’s Deferral Account as soon as practicable after the date the bonus could have otherwise been paid in cash. (c) Employer Matching Contribution Credits for a Plan Year will be credited to the Participant’s Matching Account as of the last day of the Plan Year. A Participant’s Account, including earnings credited thereto, will be maintained by the Committee until the Participant’s Plan benefits have been paid in full. 4.3 Valuation of Accounts. - 14 -

Each Participant’s Account will be valued daily as of each Valuation Date. 4.4 Credited Earnings. (a) Every Valuation Date during a Plan Year, a Participant’s Account will be credited with an equivalent of a daily rate of simple interest based on the yield on United States Treasury securities (not indexed for inflation) with a constant maturity of ten (10) years, as of the first business day of January preceding such Plan Year, plus two hundred seventy (270) basis points. This rate shall be determined on the basis of Federal Reserve Statistical Release H-15 (or any successor statistical release of the Federal Reserve) and, if there is no such statistical release, on the basis of such other generally recognized source of information concerning the market for United States Treasury securities as the Committee selects. ARTICLE V. PAYMENT OF PLAN BENEFITS 5.1 Scheduled In-Service Benefits. (a) In-Service Benefits. Each of a Participant’s Scheduled In-Service Accounts will be distributed in a lump sum within the 90-day period commencing on the Scheduled Pay Date applicable to such Scheduled In-Service Account. The lump sum amount will be the value of the applicable Participant’s Scheduled In- Service Account as of the Scheduled Pay Date. (b) Intervening Separation or Death. Notwithstanding the preceding, should an event occur prior to the Scheduled Pay Date of any Scheduled In-Service Account that would trigger a distribution under Section 5.2 or 5.3 earlier than the Scheduled Pay Date, such Scheduled In-Service Account or Accounts shall be distributed in accordance with Section 5.2 or 5.3, as applicable, and not in accordance with Section 5.1(a). 5.2 Separation Benefits. (a) Separation Benefits. In the event of a Participant’s Separation from Service, the Participant’s Scheduled In-Service Accounts will be distributed in a lump sum under Section 5.2(b) and the Participant’s Retirement Accounts will be distributed in one of the forms provided in Section 5.2(b) or 5.2(c) below in accordance with the Participant’s distribution election given effect under the provisions of Section 5.4 with respect to each such Retirement Account. (b) Lump Sum Distributions. (1) Any lump sum to be paid under this Section 5.2(b) shall be paid within the 90-day period commencing on the Participant’s Separation Pay Date. - 15 -

(2) The lump sum amount will be the value of the Participant’s Account, or Retirement Account, as applicable, as of the last day of the month preceding the date of the distribution. (c) Installment Distributions. (1) If a Participant’s Retirement Account is to be distributed in the form of annual installments, the first such installment shall be made within the 90- day period commencing on the first January 31 following the Participant’s Separation from Service; provided, however, that if such January 31 is earlier than the Participant’s Separation Pay Date, the first such installment shall be made within the 90-day period commencing on the Participant’s Separation Pay Date. Subsequent installments shall be made within the 90-day period commencing on each successive January 31, until the Participant’s benefits under such Account are distributed in full. (2) The Plan benefits will be paid in equal annual installments in an amount which would fully amortize a loan equal to the lump sum value of the Participant’s Retirement Account determined in accordance with Section 5.2(b)(2) (using as the distribution date the date of the first installment) over the installment period, with interest calculated at the per annum rate in effect for the Plan Year in which the Participant’s Separation from Service occurs. 5.3 Death Benefits. (a) General. In the event of the Participant’s death before incurring a Separation from Service or before commencement of benefits, the Participant’s Account will be distributed in one of the forms provided in Section 5.3(b) or 5.3(c) below in accordance with the Participant’s distribution election given effect under the provisions of Section 5.4 below. A Participant may elect only one form of payment under the Plan for all beneficiaries (at any level). If the Participant fails to make an effective election as provided in Section 5.4 below, the Participant will be deemed to have elected distribution in a lump sum under Section 5.3(b) for all beneficiary levels. (b) Lump Sum Distributions. (1) Any lump sum to be paid under this Section 5.3(b) shall be paid within the 90-day period commencing on the last day of the month in which the Participant’s death occurs. (2) The lump sum amount will be the value of the Participant’s Account as of the last day of the month preceding the date of distribution. (c) Installment Distributions. - 16 -

(1) If the Participant’s Account is to be distributed in the form of annual installments, the first such installment shall be made within the 90-day period commencing on the first January 31 coincident with or next following the Participant’s death. Subsequent installments will be made during the 90-day period commencing on each successive January 31, until the Participant’s benefits are distributed in full. (2) The Plan benefits will be paid in equal annual installments in an amount which would fully amortize a loan equal to the lump sum value of the Participant’s Account determined in accordance with Section 5.3(b)(2) (using as the distribution date the date of the first installment) over the installment period, with interest calculated at the per annum rate in effect for the Plan Year in which the Participant’s death occurs. (d) Death After Commencement of Installments. Notwithstanding the preceding, in the event of a Participant’s death after installment payments to the Participant have commenced, such installment payments shall continue to be made to the Participant’s designated beneficiary in the same manner as they were being distributed to the Participant prior to his or her death, provided, however, that if the Participant’s distribution election applicable to Section 5.3(a) is a lump sum payment, the Participant’s remaining installments will be distributed in lump sum to the Participant’s designated beneficiary within the 90-day period commencing on the last day of the month in which the Participant’s death occurs. (e) Designation of Beneficiary. A Participant may, by written or electronic instrument delivered to the Committee in the form prescribed by the Committee, designate primary and contingent beneficiaries (which may be a trust or trusts) to receive any benefit payments which may be payable under this Plan following the Participant’s death, and may designate the proportions in which such beneficiaries are to receive such payments. A Participant may change such designation from time to time and the last designation filed with the Committee in accordance with its procedures prior to the Participant’s death will control. In the event no beneficiary is designated, or if all designated beneficiaries predecease the Participant, payment shall be payable to the following “default” beneficiaries of the Participant in the following order of priority: (1) the Participant’s surviving spouse known to the Committee, if any; (2) the Participant’s living children known to the Committee in equal shares; (3) the Participant’s living parents known to the Committee in equal shares; (4) the Participant’s surviving siblings known to the Committee in equal shares; or (5) the
beneficiary’s estate for distribution in accordance with the terms of the beneficiary’s last will and testament or as a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine. (f) Death of Beneficiary. In the event a beneficiary dies before full payment of the Participant’s benefits under the Plan, benefits that would have been paid to such beneficiary shall continue in the same form in equal shares to the remaining - 17 -

beneficiaries at the same level (i.e., primary, contingent) and, if none, to the next level of beneficiaries. If there are no beneficiaries at the next level, then any remaining benefits shall be paid to the following “default” beneficiaries of the last living beneficiary in the following order of priority: (1) the beneficiary’s surviving spouse known to the Committee, if any; (2) the beneficiary’s living children known to the Committee in equal shares; (3) the beneficiary’s surviving parents known to the Committee in equal shares; (4) the beneficiary’s surviving siblings known to the Committee in equal shares; or (5) the beneficiary’s estate for distribution in accordance with the terms of the beneficiary’s last will and testament or as a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine. 5.4 Form of Distribution. (a) Forms Available. In the event of a Participant’s Separation from Service, or in the event of a Participant’s death if the Participant dies prior to Separation from Service, distribution of his or her Retirement Account or, in the event of death, his or her Account, may be made, at the Participant’s election per this Section 5.4, in one of the following forms: (1) a lump sum; (2) subject to the minimum account value restriction below, substantially equal annual installments over a period not to exceed fifteen (15) years; or (3) solely with respect to distribution of the Participant’s Account in the event of death, partially a lump sum and, subject to the minimum account value restriction below, substantially equal annual installments over a period not to exceed fifteen (15) years; provided, however, that an installment election will be given effect only if, as of the date on which any lump sum payment would be valued, the value of the Participant’s Retirement Account, or, in the event of death, Account, is at least fifty thousand dollars ($50,000). Any Participant whose Retirement Account, or in the event of death, Account, is valued at less than fifty thousand dollars ($50,000) as of the date on which any lump sum payment would be valued shall be defaulted to a lump sum payment. (b) Subsequent Elections. In accordance with the procedures and rules established by the Company, a Participant may change his or her distribution election (or deemed distribution election) with respect to his or her Retirement Account, or, in the event of death, his or her Account, per this Section 5.4 at any time by making a new election (referred to in this subsection as a “subsequent election”) on a form (which may be electronic) approved by Walmart’s Executive Compensation department and filed with Executive Compensation; provided, however, that such subsequent election shall be subject
to the following restrictions: - 18 -

(1) A subsequent election may not take effect until at least twelve (12) months after the date on which such subsequent election is made; (2) Payment or initial payment pursuant to a subsequent election may not be made earlier than five (5) years from the date such payment would have been made absent the subsequent election (but, for this purpose, installment payments shall not commence until the first January 31 after such delay), unless the distribution is made on account of the Participant’s death; (3) A subsequent election related to a payment must be made not less than twelve (12) months before the date the payment is scheduled to be paid; (4) Payment of a Participant’s Retirement Account or, in the event of death, Account, pursuant to a subsequent election must be completed by the last day of the Plan Year which contains the twentieth (20th) anniversary of the Participant’s Separation Pay Date or the Participant’s death; (5) For purposes of this Section 5.4(b) and Code Section 409A, the entitlement to annual installment payments is treated as the entitlement to a single payment. If a Participant’s distribution election does not satisfy the requirements of this Section 5.4(b), it will not be recognized or given effect by the Committee. In that event, distribution of the benefit will be made in accordance with the Participant’s most recent distribution election which does satisfy the requirements of this Section 5.4(b). (c) Filing of Election. A Participant’s distribution election applicable to the Participant’s Account in the event of the Participant’s death prior to Separation from Service, and a Participant’s distribution election with respect to the Participant’s Retirement Account or Retirement Accounts, and the Participant’s Scheduled Pay Date with respect to the Participant’s Scheduled In-Service Accounts, must be filed with Executive Compensation on forms (which may be electronic) prescribed by Executive Compensation. 5.5 Distributions for Unforeseeable Emergencies. (a) In the event of an Unforeseeable Emergency, the Committee or its delegate, in its sole and absolute discretion and upon written application of a Participant or, following the Participant’s death, the beneficiary to whom a Participant’s benefits are then being paid, or will be paid, pursuant to Section 5.3, may direct immediate distribution of all or a portion of the Participant’s Account (excluding the Participant’s Matching Account and related earnings if the Participant is not fully vested in his or her Matching Account). The Committee will permit distribution on account of an Unforeseeable Emergency only to the extent reasonably necessary to satisfy the emergency need, plus
amounts necessary to pay federal, state or local income taxes and penalties reasonably - 19 -

anticipated to result from the distribution, after taking into account the extent to which such need is or may be relieved through reimbursement or compensation by insurance, by liquidation of the Participant’s or beneficiary’s assets (to the extent the liquidation of such assets would not itself cause severe financial hardship), or by cessation of deferrals under the Plan. Any distribution under this Section 5.5 shall first be made from the Participant’s Scheduled In-Service Accounts with respect to Deferral Credits made in the same Plan Year as the Distribution under this Section 5.5(a), and then from the Participant’s Retirement Accounts with respect to Deferral Credits made in the same Plan Year as the Distribution under this Section 5.5(a), and then proratably from the remaining amount of the Participant’s Scheduled In-Service Accounts and then proratably from the Participant’s Retirement Accounts. (b) Notwithstanding anything in the Plan to the contrary, if Walmart reasonably anticipates that its deduction with respect to any distribution under this Section 5.5 that occurs prior to January 1, 2021 would not be permitted due to the application of Code Section 162(m); such payment shall be suspended to the extent a deduction would not be permitted until the earliest date at which it reasonably anticipates that the deduction of such distribution would not be barred by application of Code Section 162(m); provided, however, that the conditions of Section 5.5(a) are still satisfied as of such date. 5.6 Distributions for Payment of Taxes Walmart’s Senior Vice President of Global Compensation, or any successor position, may accelerate and pay a portion of a Participant’s Plan benefits in a lump sum equal to (a) the Federal Insurance Contributions Act tax imposed on Plan benefits and any income tax withholding related to such amounts, as well as (b) any state, local or foreign tax obligations arising from participation in the Plan (and related withholding under Code Section 3401) that apply to the amounts deferred under the Plan before such amount is paid or made available to the Participant. 5.7 Reductions Arising from a Participant’s Gross Misconduct. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, a Participant’s Plan benefits are contingent upon the Participant not engaging in Gross Misconduct while employed with any Employer or Related Affiliate or any entity in which Walmart has an ownership interest, or during such additional period as provided in Walmart’s Statement of Ethics. In the event the Committee determines that the Participant has engaged in Gross Misconduct during the prescribed period, then notwithstanding any provisions hereunder
to the contrary: (a) the Participant shall forfeit all Employer Matching Contribution Credits and credited Plan earnings thereon; (b) earnings credited to the Participant’s Deferral Account shall be recalculated for each Plan Year to reflect the amount which would otherwise have been credited if the applicable per annum rate were fifty percent (50%) of the per annum rate in effect for such Plan Year; and (c) if the Participant is then receiving installment payments, any remaining - 20 -

installments shall be recalculated to reflect the amount which would otherwise have been paid if the applicable per annum rate were fifty percent (50%) of the per annum rate in effect with respect to such installment payments. Under no circumstances will a Participant forfeit any portion of the Participant’s Deferred Compensation, Deferred MIP Bonus and Deferred Special Bonus. Any payments received hereunder by a Participant (or the Participant’s beneficiary) are contingent upon the Participant not engaging (or not having engaged) in Gross Misconduct while employed with any Employer or Related Affiliate or any entity in which Walmart has an ownership interest, or during such additional period as provided in Walmart’s Statement of Ethics. If the Committee determines, after payment of amounts hereunder, that the Participant has engaged in Gross Misconduct during the prescribed period, the Participant (or the Participant’s beneficiary) shall repay to Walmart any amount in excess of that to which the Participant is entitled under this Section 5.7. ARTICLE VI. ADMINISTRATION 6.1 General. The Committee is responsible for the administration of the Plan and is granted the following rights and duties: (a) The Committee shall have the exclusive duty, authority and discretion to interpret and construe the provisions of the Plan, to determine eligibility for and the amount of any benefit payable under the Plan, and to decide any dispute which may arise regarding the rights of Participants (or their beneficiaries) under this Plan; (b) The Committee shall have the authority to adopt, alter, and repeal such administrative rules, regulations, and practices governing the operation of the Plan as it shall from time to time deem advisable; (c) The Committee may appoint a person or persons to act on behalf of, or to assist, the Committee in the administration of the Plan, establishment of forms (including electronic forms) desirable for Plan operation, and such other matters as the Committee deems necessary or appropriate; (d) The decision of the Committee in matters pertaining to this Plan shall be final, binding, and conclusive upon Walmart, any Related Affiliate, the Participant, the Participant’s beneficiary, and upon any person affected by such decision, subject to the claims procedure set forth in Article VII; and - 21 -

(a) The Committee shall have the authority to allocate, from time to time, by instrument in writing filed in its records, all or any part of its respective responsibilities under the Plan to one or more of its members as may be deemed advisable, and in the same manner to revoke such allocation of responsibilities. In the exercise of such allocated responsibilities, any action of the member to whom responsibilities are allocated shall have the same force and effect for all purposes hereunder as if such action had been taken by the Committee. The Committee shall not be liable for any acts or omissions of such member. The member to whom responsibilities have been allocated shall periodically report to the Committee concerning the discharge of the allocated responsibilities. (b) The Committee shall have the authority to delegate, from time to time, by written instrument filed in its records, all or any part of its responsibilities under the Plan to such person or persons as the Committee may deem advisable (and may authorize such person to delegate such responsibilities to such other person or persons as the Committee shall authorize) and in the same manner to revoke any such delegation of responsibility. Any action of the delegate in the exercise of such delegated responsibilities shall have the same force and effect for all purposes hereunder as if such action had been taken by the Committee. The Committee shall not be liable for any acts or omissions of any such delegate. The delegate shall periodically report to the Committee concerning the discharge of the delegated responsibilities.

If the claim is not filed within one (1) year of the Participant’s Separation from Service, neither the Plan nor any Employer nor any Related Affiliate shall have any obligation to pay the benefit and the claimant shall have no further rights under the Plan. If a timely claim for a Plan benefit is wholly or partially denied, notice of the decision will be furnished to the claimant by the Committee or its delegate within a reasonable period of time, not to exceed sixty (60) days, after receipt of the claim by the Committee or its delegate, unless special circumstances require an
